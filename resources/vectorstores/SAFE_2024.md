## LETTER FROM THE CEO

Dear shareholders,

2024 has been  a year of adaptation and efficiency for Safetech Innovations . In a complex economic and geopolitical environment, we remained focused on process optimization, responsible cost management, particularly at our UK entity, and strengthening our position in Romania's cybersecurity  market .  We  carefully  analyzed every strategic decision, implemented measures to streamline operations, and prioritized investments with a direct impact on financial performance. This sustained effort has enabled us to conclude 2024 with strong financial results, reflecting both the maturity of our  business  model  and  our team's ability  to

<!-- image -->

respond swiftly and effectively to the increasingly sophisticated demands of the market.

Over the past year , revenue from cybersecurity solutions sales grew by 32%, while revenue from service  provision  increased  by  46%.  These  developments  contributed  to  an  increase  in  the profitability rate to 32%. As a result, in 2024, at an individual level , the company's total revenues reached RON 59.8 million (compared to a budgeted RON 57.1 million), marking a 28% increase compared  to  2023.  Of  the  total  turnover  of RON  42.3  million (+36%  compared  to  2023), cybersecurity  services  contributed  39%,  while  the  implementation  of  cybersecurity  solutions accounted for 61%.

In 2024, we acquired 35 new clients in the Romanian market. Thus, we ended the year with an individual  net  profit  of  RON  13.5  million (compared  to  a  budgeted  RON  13.8  million), representing a 39% increase from the previous year. This achievement is even more significant considering that our company has not benefited from any tax incentives, including income tax exemptions  for  employees  engaged  in  research  and  development  activities. Furthermore, Safetech personnel have not benefited from IT sector tax breaks in previous years either, meaning that the amendments introduced by the so-called 'little train' ordinance have no impact on our company from this perspective.

Even though we achieved our budgetary targets at an individual level , the political uncertainty in Romania during the latter part of the year influenced some clients' decisions, leading to the postponement or cancellation of certain cybersecurity solution implementations. This context limited our ability to exceed the budgeted profit as initially estimated, impacting, in particular, our consolidated results.

On a consolidated  level ,  where  the  results  of  the  UK  entity  (Safetech  UK)  are  also  included, revenues  amounted  to 60.4  million  lei  in  2024 (64.8  million  lei  budgeted), and  net  profit recorded  a  remarkable  increase  of  189%, reaching 11.1  million  lei (13.1  million  lei  budgeted), compared to 3.8 million lei in the previous year. In the United Kingdom, in 2024, we signed 11 new clients, with some of these contracts being recurring contracts (monitoring and testing). The UK subsidiary is making progress and is recognized as a trusted player in the market. Even though in 2024 it did not manage to achieve the ambitious objectives set, the revenues generated from cybersecurity services were consistent , which, along with the optimization of expenses and the personnel structure, provides us with solid (encouraging) premises for the year 2025. We estimate total expenses in the United Kingdom to be approximately 2.16 million lei (360,000 pounds) annually , and the contracts signed in 2024, along with those already concluded this year, give us confidence that the subsidiary will become financially independent in a mature market with

<!-- image -->

considerable potential. We continue to focus on the small and medium-sized client segment in the UK (and the USA), where the company has gained traction and where we have received positive reviews from reference clients.

In  Saudi  Arabia,  where  we  completed  the  establishment  of  the  local  entity  at  the  end  of December 2024, we expect to sign our first contracts by the end of the first semester of this year . Our goal is for this subsidiary to achieve profitability by the end of 2025, given the growing interest  of  companies  in  the  region  for  advanced  cybersecurity  solutions.  The  cybersecurity industry in Saudi Arabia saw significant growth in 2024, valued at approximately USD 5 billion, with projections indicating growth to around USD 7 billion by 2029. The rapid development of this sector is driven by a combination of government initiatives and substantial private sector investments  aimed  at  strengthening digital infrastructure  and  enhancing  cybersecurity resilience  in  critical  industries  such  as  energy,  finance,  and  healthcare.  These  developments create a favorable environment for our local entity, providing us with the opportunity to position ourselves as a trusted partner and capitalize on the substantial potential of this market.

In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) , our activities in 2024 focused on capitalizing on cybersecurity opportunities, but the manner of conducting business in this country, as we have mentioned before, is significantly different from Europe, as the emphasis is solely on large projects. We would like  to  remind  that  this  entity  is  not  included  in  our  consolidation.  In  2024,  the  cybersecurity industry in the UAE saw significant developments, strengthened by major government initiatives. The UAE Cybersecurity Council developed three new policies, issued before the end of the year, focusing  on  cloud  and  data  security,  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  security,  and  Cybersecurity Operations Centers (CSOC). These measures were aimed at strengthening the country's digital infrastructure  and  highlight  the  considerable  potential  of  this  cybersecurity  market,  offering significant opportunities for capable companies like Safetech to adapt to local requirements and participate in large-scale projects.

Regarding the  development  potential  of  the  cybersecurity  industry ,  Safetech  Innovations remains in a privileged position to continue long-term growth, given the current dynamics of the cybersecurity  market  in  Romania  and  worldwide.  In  Romania,  according  to  the  National Cybersecurity  Directorate  (DNSC), there  are  between  25,000  and  50,000  cyberattacks registered  daily .  The  majority  of  these  attacks  are  detected  and  neutralized  thanks  to  the advanced security systems implemented by authorities and companies. However, on average, once every two to three months, an attack manages to cause a major incident. Despite the high number of attacks, only 40% of companies in Romania are actively investing in cybersecurity . This is particularly concerning given the extremely high risk of being targeted by a cyberattack, considering the increasing complexity and frequency of threats in the digital environment. This highlights  the  need  for  increased  efforts  in  education  and  awareness,  as  well  as  greater involvement from authorities to encourage investments in digital protection.

The exponential growth in the number of cyberattacks calls for advanced protection solutions, a demand that our company is well-positioned to meet through our accumulated expertise and diversified portfolio of services and products . Additionally, the implementation of the NIS2 Directive  and  its  transposition  into  national  legislation  through  Emergency  Ordinance  no. 155/2024, establishing a framework for the cybersecurity of networks and information systems in the  national  civil  cyberspace,  requires  local  companies  to  proactively  invest  in  cybersecurity. Safetech Innovations is positioning itself as a strategic ally in this transition.

Thus, for 2025, we are confident toward new growth opportunities ,  even though it is a year marked  by  political  uncertainties  both  locally  and  internationally.  We  plan  to  increase  both turnover and net profit at the individual and consolidated levels, driven by the operationalization of the Saudi Arabian company and the optimization of operations in the United Kingdom. In fact, the recurring contracts signed so far exceed this year's estimated expenses by 20% , providing us with a solid foundation for achieving our objectives.

Additionally, we continue to actively engage in projects funded by European and national funds, as  part  of  national  and  international  consortia,  which  allows  us  to  innovate  and  expand  our

<!-- image -->

portfolio of solutions and services. Since 2024, we have been involved in five research projects funded by European or national funds, with a total value of approximately RON 14 million . In 2025, we will continue to closely monitor such projects available at both national and European levels, submitting our applications accordingly.

Last  but  not  least,  I  would  like  to thank  you  for  the  trust  and  support  you  have  given  us, standing by our side in this long-term growth journey . We appreciate your loyalty, and in this context, we aim to reward you as shareholders .

Following the General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) in April, we plan to hold another GMS in June, during which we will propose for approval the distribution of a dividend of at least 0.02 lei  per  share  from  last  year's  profit .  Further  details  will  be  established  depending  on  the decisions adopted during this GMS, based on the proposals made by the Company's Board of Directors. We will provide more information as soon as we have concrete details on this matter.

I invite you to read in the following pages more details about Safetech's performance in 2024. In case of any questions related to our activity, whether it is about the business or the company's activity on the capital market, please do not hesitate to contact us at investors@safetech.ro .

## ABOUT SAFETECH INNOVATIONS

## BRIEF HISTORY

Safetech  Innovations  S.A. (the 'Company", "the Issuer", "Safetech",  "the  Company")  is  a cybersecurity company from Romania, founded by certified information security experts with extensive proven experience in security projects for institutions and companies from all sectors. The Company was established as a limited liability company (S.R.L.) by Victor Gânsac, Paul Rusu, Teodor Lupan, and Adrian Vlada in 2011.

The main change in Safetech's business strategy occurred in 2016 when management decided to focus on value-added services instead of hardware sales, which in previous years contributed significantly to revenues but had a low profit margin.

In  2016,  Safetech  established  its  own  Research  and  Development  department  using  its  own financial resources. Currently, the Company has a number of proprietary cybersecurity products under development or intended for development.

Prior to admission to trading on the multilateral trading system operated by the Bucharest Stock Exchange, the Company was transformed into a joint-stock company (S.A.), owned at that time by two shareholders, the co-founders of the Company, Victor Gânsac and Paul Rusu.

In October 2020, prior to admission to trading on the AeRO market operated by the Bucharest Stock Exchange, the Issuer successfully carried out a private placement, raising a total of RON 2.5 million  from  investors,  after  the  offer  was  oversubscribed  in  37  seconds,  reaching  a  record subscription rate of 857%, respectively, the highest subscription rate of an offer carried out by a private company listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange in the last six years, calculated at that respective time.

On January 29 th , 2021, Safetech Innovations (SAFE) shares debuted on the AeRO market of the Bucharest Stock Exchange. On the first day of listing, shares worth RON 8.9 million were traded, and the price reached RON 24 per share, 500% higher than the price in the private placement.

On January 6 th , 2022, the Company informed investors about the completion of the first stage of the share capital increase, carried out from December 6, 2021, to January 5, 2022.

## RESEARCH &amp; PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS

In 2016, Safetech set up its own Research and Development department, using its own financial resources. Currently, the Company has a number of proprietary cybersecurity products under development or that it intends to develop, which will bring new added value to customers. In addition, the Company operates a private emergency response team in Romania, called STI CERT -  Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) / Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT),  available  to  customers  in  the  public  and  private  sectors,  which  provides  continuous monitoring cybersecurity threats and intervention in the event of security incidents. STI CERT is designed to support companies, institutions and organizations that want to be protected against cyber-attacks through continuous monitoring (24/7), prompt response and rapid recovery from cybersecurity incidents. STI CERT is accredited at European level by the Trusted Introducer and offers a 24/7 monitoring system, alerting, incident management and forensic research.

The  company  wants  to  further  develop  patented  products. So  far,  Safetech  has  four  such products in its portfolio, monetized both through subscription sales to clients and by optimizing operations through their use in service delivery:

iSAM -  In  March  2019,  Safetech  launched  its  first  cybersecurity  product  -  iSAM,  Information Security Automation Manager. iSAM enables companies' information security managers to better manage cybersecurity within their organizations, automating certain processes, providing realtime  updates  on  the  level  of  cyber  protection,  and  enabling  early  detection  of  cybersecurity threats.  Safetech  holds  the  certificate  of  registration  in  the  National  Register  of  Computer Programs for iSAM. The certificate was issued on 22.01.2020 by the Romanian Copyright Office.

The main features of the application developed by Safetech include:

- inventory of business processes and information systems;
- management of security policies and standards within the organization;
- continuous analysis and management of risks and vulnerabilities;
- security event and incident management.

The  solution  automates  some  of  the  activities  of  information  security  officers,  but  also  helps organize security reports, gathering information from various departments, thus saving time, and aligning the practices used in a company. The platform also has the option to generate reports on the level of IT security within the organization almost instantly, as well as to provide tools for managing security and risk indicators.

The solution is mainly addressed to large companies in the financial-banking, health, transport, energy, utilities, as well as digital infrastructure sectors, ensuring compliance with the relevant IT security  provisions  applicable  to  these  industries.  iSAM  helps  companies  comply  with  the following regulations currently applicable in Romania:

- Law 362/2018 on ensuring a high level of security of computer networks and systems;
- Norm 4/2018 of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) on operational risk management;
- NBR Regulation 3/2018 on monitoring the financial market and infrastructure of payment instruments;
- General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (GDPR).

The capitalization of the project is done by two methods:

- Capitalization in the form of either a perpetual license or a subscription (annual service on premises - renewable annually) to the beneficiaries of the company.

<!-- image -->

- Capitalization in the form of streamlining the activity within the structure of the company type Security Operations Center - STI CERT, both in the daily activities of monitoring the security  of  the  company's  beneficiaries,  and  in  the  security  testing  and  information security management services.

ToR-SIM (research project completed in 2020) - Utilization in the form of either a perpetual license or  subscription  (annual service on premises) to the integrated software platform for malware analysis of mobile terminals (Acronym: ToR-SIM). A software platform that seamlessly integrates malware analysis procedures for most existing devices on the market today, in order to enhance the  security  of  terminals  and  networks,  identify  operational  requirements  and  capabilities  to develop  and  secure  solutions  for  mobile  devices  and  applications  that  to  ensure,  through  a partnership  between  the  responsible  governmental  factors,  the  academic  and  industrial environment,  the  increase  of  the  efficiency  of  the  cyber  protection  solutions.  The  platform  is developed at the prototype level, validated by a single beneficiary (the one established by the research  project,  which  accepted  that  the  product  was  developed  according  to  the  project requirements). The development of the product at the level of commercial product will continue if the need is found in the market.

SafePic -  Aims  to  increase  the  response  capacity  of  STI-CERT  to  cybersecurity  attacks  and incidents,  through  automation  and  interoperability  with  similar  structures  at  national  and international level, but also organizational development by carrying out a set of actions to design and implement measures to improve the components of the management system (strategy, structure,  information  system,  decision-making  system,  methodological  system),  designed  to increase the performance and competitiveness of the organization.

SAFECyberRange - The Cyber Range software platform, developed with in-house resources, is a platform  that  enables  training  in  awareness,  prevention,  identification,  classification,  and counteraction of potential cyberattacks by providing viable and rapid solutions. At the same time, it  offers  a  collaborative  and  competitive  environment  for  training,  testing,  and  disseminating information as a result of competitions held between various teams, according to the instructor's guidelines.

The  platform  can  be  installed  at  the  beneficiaries'  location  on  a  dedicated  physical  server infrastructure, in a virtualized environment, or can be offered as a SaaS solution by SAFETECH INNOVATIONS SA.

The Cyber Range software platform primarily focuses on two use cases:

- (i) The  creation  and  provision  of  a  simulation  environment  for  IT  infrastructures  in  a controlled setting to achieve a high level of flexibility, scalability, isolation, and portability. The  platform  allows  for  the  creation  of  virtual  networks  with  operating  systems, applications, and network devices that simulate real-world systems.
- (ii) The conduct of simultaneous training sessions in the form of cybersecurity games/competitions,  complemented  by  an  evaluation  of  participants.  The  platform enables  instructors  to  create  training  scenarios,  while  trainees  engage  in  training sessions through the simulated virtual environment provided by the platform

## DIFERENTIATION FROM COMPETITION

Other operating revenues decreased by 38% in 2024, up to 1 million lei, the significant share of these revenues representing subsidies for investments transferred into revenues and corresponding  to  the  depreciation  recorded  for  own  solutions  (non-reimbursable  European funds project, completed in 2019).

Revenue from the production of fixed assets grew by 16% in 2024, up to 16.5 million lei. These represent investments in intangible assets made from European funds, national research funds, and the company's own resources for the development of Safetech's proprietary products.

The  second  significant  cost  was  represented  by  raw  materials  and consumables expenses, which increased by 93% compared to 2023, reaching 13.8 million lei. The larger size of the business drives this increase and represents the cost of implemented solutions.

Other operating expenses increased by 11% during the year, up to 4.8 million lei. This category includes  third-party  services,  royalty  expenses,  management  premises,  rents,  and  postal  and telecommunications taxes. The increase was driven by an increase in services performed by third parties. The costs of goods amounted to 8.6 million lei.

Depreciation and amortization increased by 6% in 2024, up to 2.57 million lei, and represent fixed assets, such  as laptops, furniture, monitors, a process  automation  solution,  as well as cybersecurity  solutions.  These  elements  generate  expenses  with  monthly  amortization  by amortizing them using the straight-line method.

The  category  of  provisions,  in  the  amount  of  54  thousand  lei,  represents  the  resumption  of provisions for holidays not taken in 2023.

At  the  individual  level,  the  operating  result  in  2024  reached  15.54  million  lei,  a  40%  increase compared to the same period last year, due to the larger scale of business and the increased focus on higher-margin services.

Financial expenses increased by 25% compared to last year, reaching 281 thousand lei. At the same time, financial revenues decreased by 40% in 2024, up to 68 thousand lei.

The  income  tax increased to 1.8 million lei at the end of the year, a 42% increase, thus exceeding the increase in the gross result due to the fact that, starting from 2024, the reporting and calculation of the profit tax is carried out according to IFRS standards. Therefore, the net result for the year was 13.5 million lei, a 39% increase compared to 2023.

## BUSINESS &amp; SALES STRATEGY

The goal of management is always targeted on profit, not revenue, and this can be achieved through an appropriate sales and marketing strategy that covers multiple sectors and markets. In 2024, given the demand of the markets but also of the legislative context, the business strategy is focused on increasing the number of new clients and implicitly the profitability.

Safetech's sales team applies the method of advisory sales, being the most appropriate method for  the  type  of  services  and  solutions  that  the  Company  offers.  Each  client/potential  client  is assigned  a  dedicated  salesperson  who  together  with  the  team  of  specialists,  identifies  and proposes solutions and services that cover the requirements formulated by the client. Thus, with each  client  won,  there  is  a  significant  potential  to  increase  the  value  of  the  services  initially contracted.  For  example,  security  monitoring  contracts  usually  come  bundled  with  the governance,  security  risk  and  compliance  service.  For  customers  requesting  security  tests, additional services are usually recommended following the test result.

In support of sales efforts, the sales team benefits from the expertise of the Company's technical specialists who provide support in organizing free demonstrations of portfolio solutions through pilot implementations, to prove the ability to implement these solutions in the infrastructure of potential clients.

The 2024 marketing budget was built to support the activities of generating new opportunities using mainly digital channels such as websites, social networks, publishing articles in press. The most important activity is the organization of webinars, with a bi-monthly frequency, conducted with  own  resources  or  in  collaboration  with  technology  partners  aimed  at  disseminating information on cybersecurity risks to which all types of organizations are exposed.

In order to achieve the objective of increasing the number of customers and profitability, the company has taken the first steps, including in terms of opening international sales channels.

All  these activities are supported by software tools such as ERP, CRM, Marketing Automation, Resource Management, Team Collaboration, which began to be implemented in 2020 in order to integrate and automate business processes.

## SIGNIFICANT CLIENTS

| Client   | Sector                 | Share   |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| Client 1 | Banking                | 20%     |
| Client 2 | Information Technology | 18%     |
| Client 3 | Telecommunications     | 9%      |
| Client 4 | Utilities              | 6%      |
| Client 5 | Retail                 | 4%      |

In 2024, the largest 5 clients of the company had a share of approximately 58% of total turnover. The concentration of revenues of certain selected customers can be explained by the fact that the market to which Safetech addresses is represented by medium or large companies. Top 5 clients  are  large  companies  in the financial-banking or utilities sector, companies with which Safetech has had strategic partnerships for years and have been running multi-annual contracts for at least 3 years. Under these contracts, Safetech delivers diversified packages of services and solutions. It is important to mention that, from a historical point of view, the first 5 customers have never remained the same but have changed every year. This is caused by a different level of needs each year, as well as the resale of other adhesion services.

The high concentration of revenues, but also of suppliers is specific to mature economies, as Romania is becoming, with quite concentrated markets and business verticals. In almost any business, the commercial results have a Pareto type distribution (80/20), which is natural. For example, if a business wants to sell specific or specialized services, this leads to a narrow, niche list of suppliers, in order to determine the concentration of human resources specialization on the niche segment in which it operates and thus the list of customers that contribute to the largest share of income is reduced. In practice for specialized activities, concentrated revenues come from multi-annual contracts, framework contracts that generate recurring revenues.

In  conclusion,  the  above-mentioned percentages of 58% per client can indicate a risk only in theory,  in  practice  they  are  natural,  a  consequence  of  the  way  the  free  market  works.  Risk reduction  is  achieved  through  business  development  activities  that  include  prospecting, qualification  and  contracting  new  clients  who,  through  loyalty  strategies,  become  recurring sources of income. It is important to note that a company's need for cybersecurity services never ends - which means that the business model predicts that new customers will continually need cybersecurity  services  and  for  certain  services  and  products,  Safetech  is  among  the  few authorized suppliers on the local market.

## MAIN OPERATIONAL INDICATORS

The  main  operational  indicators  with  which  the  company  measures  the  productivity  and efficiency of the activity are: profitability, value productivity, the degree of customer satisfaction, the degree of employee satisfaction.

From  the  point  of  view  of  business  strategy,  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  share  of individual business lines in total revenues may differ from year to year. This is due to the fact that Safetech Innovations team is flexible and adapts to the needs of the market, and always aims to be profitable. Given the legislative context and demand, individual services may have different profit margins each year. The objective of management is to always pursue profit rather than income and prioritize value-added projects with the highest profit margins.

|                   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |
|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Net profit margin | 21%    | 27%    | 30%    | 31%    | 32%    |

It is important to note that Safetech's sales team is rewarded with a bonus from each sale. The bonus varies from 1% to 5% of the gross margin, with different value depending on the line of

business and the profitability of the contract. In this way, the Company ensures that the team is motivated to join and stay in the Company and to deliver significant projects.

The company's business model allows the successful resale of other member services. Each client has a dedicated account manager who, following the discussion with the technical team that solves the client's request, can identify new opportunities, and recommend additional products or services. Thus, with each customer won, there is a significant potential to increase the value of the services delivered. For example, security monitoring contracts usually come with the security governance service. For customers requesting penetration tests, additional services are usually recommended as a result of the test result.

For potential customers interested in Safetech solutions and services, free demonstrations of the operation of the solutions are provided, through pilot implementations at their headquarters, to prove the usefulness of their implementation.

To ensure employee satisfaction, each year the Company collaborates with an external consultant who  conducts individual interviews with all employees and then reports the results, anonymously,  to  management.  As  a  result  of  this  measure,  the  Company  carried  out  a reorganization completed in 2020, as part of the process of preparing the listing on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, to maximize the benefits offered by listing and offer investors a company with a well-defined corporate structure, capable to provide consistent profits.

## INDIVIDUAL BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

As of December 31 st , 2024, total assets reached 73.45 million lei, a 27% increase compared to the end of 2023, driven by a 40% increase in intangible assets, to 56.8 million lei. Fixed assets increased by 35% in 2024, reaching 63.1 million lei, as a result of the 40% increase in intangible assets put into  operation  and  under  construction.  The  increase  in  intangible  assets  is  directly  related  to projects funded by European funds, national research funds, and the company's own resources. In accordance with the accounting legislation in force, these expenses are recorded as intangible assets in progress and represent the stage of realization of the company's own product.

The category of current assets consists primarily of receivables, which as of December 31 st , 2024 reached 8.2 million lei, up 15% compared to December 31 st , 2023. Trade receivables increased at the end of the year, as a result of new contracts that were delivered and invoiced in 2024 and have  not  yet  reached  payment  date.  These  were  in  majority  collected  by  the  moment  of publication of this report. Cash and cash equivalents reached 1,76 million lei as of December 31 st , 2024, a 50% decrease compared to December 31 st , 2023. This decrease is primarily due to the partial non-collection of amounts from funded projects, which will be collected during the first half of 2025.

As of December 31 st , 2024, equity reached 48.26 million lei, a 38% increase compared to December 31 st , 2023, due to the 145% increase in subscribed and paid-up capital, up to 32.5 million lei.

Non-current liabilities increased by 10% over the year, reaching 15.9 million lei. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in investment grants received, which rose by 13% as of December 31 st ,  2024, reaching 15 million lei. These grants are related to ongoing projects funded by nonreimbursable funds. As for leasing liabilities, they recorded a slight decrease as of December 31 st , 2024, amounting to 862 thousand lei.

Current liabilities reached 9.3 million lei as December 31 st , 2024, an increase of 11%, driven by an 68% increase in other current liabilities (which include employee salaries, VAT and payroll taxes and duties), up to 2.3 million lei. Trade and other payables, which reached 6.2 million lei, registered almost  the  same  level  compared  to  December  31 st ,  2023,  the  increase  being  just  under  1%. Liabilities related to leasing contracts increased by 30% in 2024, reaching 398K lei.

In terms of provisions, they were 24% lower in 2024 compared to the previous year. This decrease was mainly due to their recognition as revenue, reflecting the value of unused paid leave from 2023.

- As  a  growth  company  with  significant  development  potential,  the  management  of Safetech  Innovations  aims  to  achieve  a  balance  between  rewarding  shareholders  and maintaining  access  to  the  capital  needed  for  development.  Therefore,  the  Company proposes to shareholders that, depending on the investment needs each year, it will either grant a cash dividend or reward investors by granting shares free of charge, following the capitalization of a portion of the Company's net profits. The company is also considering the introduction of a hybrid model, in which part of the profits will be capitalized and shareholders will receive free shares of the company, while another part will be granted

through cash dividends, thus achieving a fair balance between allowing the company to develop, but also rewarding the shareholders.

The  decision  on approving the distribution of dividends belongs to the General Meeting of Shareholders, in accordance with the applicable law.
- Any  change  in  the  company's  dividend  policy  will  be  communicated  to  investors  in  a timely manner, through a current report sent to the market.

## PERSPECTIVE ASPECTS REGARDING ISSUER'S ACTIVITY

Regarding the growth potential of the cybersecurity industry, Safetech Innovations remains in a strong position to continue its long-term expansion, considering the current dynamics of the cybersecurity market in Romania and globally.

The exponential increase in cyberattacks requires advanced protection solutions, a demand that Safetech  Innovations  is  well-prepared  to  meet  through  its  extensive  expertise  and  diverse portfolio of services and products. Additionally, the implementation of the NIS2 directive and its transposition  into  national  legislation  through  Emergency  Ordinance  no.  155/2024,  which establishes a framework for the cybersecurity of networks and information systems within the national civil cyberspace, require local companies to proactively invest in cybersecurity. In this context, Safetech Innovations positions itself as a strategic ally in this transition.

Thus,  for  2025,  the  Company's  management  is  confident  about  new  growth  opportunities, despite a year marked by political uncertainties both locally and internationally. The Company plans to increase its revenue and net profit at both individual and consolidated levels, driven by the operational launch of its subsidiary in Saudi Arabia and the optimization of its operations in the United Kingdom.

Furthermore,  Safetech  Innovations  continues  to  actively  participate  in  projects  funded  by European grants within national and international consortia, enabling the Company to innovate and expand its portfolio of solutions and services.

The Revenue and Expense Budget for 2025, prepared by the Company's management, approved in the Annual Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders dated April 24, 2025 is available below:

## RISKS

## The risk related to scaling the business

The Issuer has recorded growth and increased demand for its products and services in recent years. As a result, the number of employees has increased significantly in recent years, and the Issuer expects it to continue this trend in the next year. For example, from the end of the fiscal year 2023 to the end of the fiscal year 2024, the number of employees increased by 16. In addition, as the Company developed, the number of end clients also increased significantly, and the Issuer managed  more  and  more  product  and  service  systems  implementations.  The  growth  and expansion of the business, its products, services, and the level of support it provides to clients place significant  pressure  on  the  management,  operational  and  financial  resources.  To  effectively manage any future growth, the Issuer must continue to improve and expand its financial and information technology  infrastructure, improve  and  expand  its  operational  and  systems infrastructure as well as operational control and administrative, and its capacity to manage assets, capital,  and  processes  effectively,  all  of  which  may  be  more  difficult  to  achieve  as  the  Issuer's employees continue to work remotely.

The Issuer may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to its systems and processes efficiently or timely. In addition, existing systems and procedures may not be able to prevent  or  detect  all  errors,  omissions,  or  fraud.  The  Issuer  may  also  experience  difficulties managing improvements to its systems and processes or in connection with software provided by third  parties  licensed  to  support  the  Issuer  in  connection  with  such  modifications.  Any  future growth would add complexity to the Issuer's organization and require effective organization-wide coordination. Failure to effectively manage future growth could increase costs, disrupt existing relationships with end clients, reduce demand or limit the Issuer to smaller deployments of its products or harm its business performance and operating results.

## Operating results may vary significantly from period to period and may be unpredictable

The  Issuer's  operating  results  may  vary  significantly  from  period  to  period  and  may  be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of the Shares to decline. Although operating results,  particularly  revenues, gross margins, operating margins, and operating expenses, have shown increases in the prior period, they may vary as a result of several factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Issuer and may be difficult to predict, including:

- the Issuer's ability to attract and retain new end clients or to sell additional products and/or services to existing end clients;
- budget  cycles,  seasonal  purchasing  patterns,  and  purchasing  practices  of  end  clients, including the likelihood of a slowdown in technology spending due to the global economic slowdown;
- changes in the requirements of end clients, distributors or resellers, or market needs;
- price competition;
- the timing and success of the introduction of new products and services by the Issuer or its competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of the industry in which the  Issuer  operates,  including  consolidation  among  its  competitors  or  end  clients  and strategic changes, partnerships concluded by to and between the Issuer's competitors;
- the  Issuer's  ability  to  successfully  and  continuously  expand  its  business  nationally  and internationally, particularly given the current global economic slowdown;

<!-- image -->

- changes in the growth rate of the cybersecurity industry;
- the Issuer's inability to complete or effectively integrate any acquisitions it may undertake;
- the increase in expenses or unforeseen liabilities and any impact on the operational results of the Issuer as a result of any acquisitions it makes;
- the ability of the Issuer to increase the scope and productivity of the distribution channel;
- decisions  by  potential  end  clients  to  purchase  cybersecurity  solutions  from  larger, internationally recognized security vendors or their primary network equipment vendors;
- the risk of insolvency or credit difficulties faced by end clients, which could increase due to the global economic situation, adversely affecting their ability to purchase or pay promptly or not at all for the Issuer's products and services, or the difficulties that the Issuer's key suppliers are facing, including its sole suppliers, which could disrupt the Issuer's supply chain;
- any disruption in the distribution channel or termination of the relationships that the Issuer has  with  important  distribution  partners,  including  due  to  the  consolidation  among distributors and resellers of cybersecurity solutions;
- the  Issuer's  inability  to  honor  end  client  orders  due  to  supply  chain  delays  or  events affecting the Issuer's suppliers  and  partners  or their  suppliers,  which may  be  adversely affected by the effects of the global economic situation;
- the cost and results of potential litigation, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Issuer's business;
- seasonality or cyclical fluctuations of the market in which the Issuer operates;
- political,  economic,  and  social  instability  caused  by  the  military  conflict  initiated  by  the Russian Federation in Ukraine, the continuation of hostilities in the Middle East, terrorist activities,  any  disruptions  caused  by  COVID-19  and/or  any  other  pandemic  or  general health crisis that may occur and any disruption on what these events could cause in the global industrial economy; and
- the general macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and in the foreign markets where the Issuer is present, which could have an impact on some or all regions in which the Issuer operates, including the expected slowdown in global economic growth, the increased risk of inflation and the potential for global recession;

Any of the  above  factors  or  the  cumulative  effect  of  some  of  the  above  factors  may  result  in significant fluctuations in the Issuer's financial and other operating results. This unpredictability could result in the Issuer's failure to meet its expectations regarding revenues, margins, or other operating results.

## Continued global economic uncertainty may have an adverse effect on the Issuer's business and operating results

The  Issuer  operates  in  a  globalized  market,  and  therefore  its  business  and  revenues  are interdependent on global macroeconomic conditions. International efforts to contain the spread of  COVID-19  have  significantly  negatively  affected  global  macroeconomic  conditions,  which continue  to  cause  economic  uncertainty.  In  addition,  the  military  conflict  generated  by  the Russian  Federation  in  Ukraine,  instability  in  global  credit  markets,  rising  prices  of  essential commodities (oil, electricity, etc,), changes in the domestic and international public policies, such as regulations, international taxes or trade agreements, international trade disputes, changes in

<!-- image -->

governments, geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets continue to add uncertainty to global economic conditions.

These adverse conditions could result in reductions in sales of the Issuer's products and services, longer sales cycles,  reductions  in  the  duration  and  value  of  contracts  with  the  Issuer's  clients, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. As a result, any continued or more significant uncertainty or deterioration in global macroeconomic and market conditions could cause end clients to change their spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions, which affect the lengthening sales cycles, any of which may harm the business and operational results of the Issuer.

## The rate of revenue growth in recent periods may not be an indicator of the Issuer's future performance

The  Issuer's  revenue  for  any  prior  quarterly  or  annual  period  should  not  be  considered  an indication of its future revenue or revenue growth for any coming period. If the Issuer cannot maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, its shares may experience high volatility, making it difficult for the Issuer to achieve and maintain profitability or maintain and/or increase cash flow consistently.

## The Issuer faces intense competition in the market in which it operates and may not have sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve its competitive position

Many of the Issuer's existing competitors have, and some of its potential competitors may have, substantial competitive advantages such as:

- greater name recognition and a longer operating history;
- larger budgets and resources for sales and marketing;
- wider distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and end clients;
- more customer support resources;
- greater resources to make strategic acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships;
- lower labor costs and new product and/or service development;
- newer and/or disruptive products and/or technologies;
- broader and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and/or
- much greater financial, technical, and other resources,

In addition, some of the Issuer's more prominent competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings, which may make them less sensitive to slowdowns in a particular  market  and  allow  them  to  leverage  their  relationships  based  on  other  products  or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a way that discourages users from purchasing the Issuer's products and/or services, including by selling at zero or negative margins,  offering  concessions  or  bundling  products.  Many  of  the  Issuer's  smaller  competitors, specializing in protecting a single type of security threat, can often bring these specialized security products to market faster than the Issuer.

Organizations using traditional products and services may find that these products and services are sufficient to meet their security needs or that the Issuer's offerings meet the needs of only a portion of the cybersecurity industry. Accordingly, these organizations may continue to allocate their information technology budgets to traditional products and services and may not adopt the

<!-- image -->

Issuer's  products  and  services.  Many  organizations  have  invested  substantial  financial  and personnel resources to design and  operate their networks  and  have  established  deep relationships with other network and security product vendors. As a result, these organizations may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than add or switch to a new supplier, such as the Issuer, regardless of product performance or better features or service offerings. These organizations  may  also  be  willing  to  incrementally  add  solutions  to  their  existing  security infrastructure management solutions rather than replace them entirely with the Issuer's solutions.

Market  conditions  in  which  the  Issuer  operates  could  change  rapidly  and  significantly  due  to technological advances, partnerships, or acquisitions carried out by the Issuer's competitors or the continued consolidation of the market. Start-up companies that innovate and major competitors of the Issuer that make significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with the Issuer's products and services. Some of the Issuer's competitors have made or may make acquisitions of companies, enabling them to directly offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions than they previously provided and to  adapt  more  quickly  to  new  technologies  and  new  end-client  needs.  Current  and  potential competitors of the Issuer may also establish cooperative relationships with each other or third parties that may further enhance their resources.

These competitive pressures in the market in which the Issuer operates, or its failure to compete effectively, may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenues, gross margins, and loss of market share. Any failure to address and face these factors could seriously harm the business and its operating results.

## A network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to the Issuer's network or data,  harm its  reputation,  create  additional  liability  issues,  and  adversely  impact  financial results

Companies are subjected to a wide variety of attacks on their networks constantly, with increasing frequency. In addition to traditional attacks led by "hackers," malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, theft, or employee misuse, sophisticated actors engage in intrusions and  attacks  (including  advanced  persistent  attacks)  that  increase  risks  to  the  Issuer's  internal networks and client-facing environments, as well as the information they store and process.

The  incidence  of  cybersecurity  breaches  has  increased.  Despite  significant  efforts  to  create security barriers to such threats, it is practically impossible for the Issuer to mitigate these risks entirely. The Issuer and third-party service providers may face security threats and attacks from various sources. The Issuer's data, corporate systems, third-party systems, and security measures may be breached due to actions of third parties, employee error, malicious act, a combination of these factors, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may gain access to the Issuer's data.

In addition, as an established provider of security solutions, the Issuer may be a more attractive target  for  such  attacks.  A  breach  in  the  security  of  the  Issuer's  data  or  an  attack  against  the availability  of  its  services  or  its  service  providers  could  affect  the  Issuer's  networks  or  secure product networks and create interruptions or slowdowns in the systems and the exploitation of security vulnerabilities of the Issuer's products, as well as information stored on its networks or those of its service providers. This data could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could cause financial harm.

Although the Issuer has not yet suffered significant damage as a result of unauthorized access by a third party to its internal network, any actual or perceived breach of the security of the Issuer's systems or networks could result in damage to its reputation, negative publicity, loss of partners, clients,  and  sales,  loss  of  competitive  advantages  over  its  competitors,  increased  costs  of

<!-- image -->

remediating any problems and incident response, regulatory investigations and law enforcement actions, costly litigation, and other liabilities.

In  addition,  the  Issuer  may  incur  high  costs  and  operational  consequences  to  investigate, remediate, remove, and implement additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches and other security incidents, as well as compliance costs with any notification obligations arising from any security incident.

Any of these adverse effects may have a negative impact on the market perception of the Issuer's products and services, as well as on the confidence of end clients and investors in the Issuer. They could seriously affect its business or operating results.

## Seasonality may cause fluctuations in the Issuer's revenue

The Issuer believes that important seasonal factors may cause the fourth fiscal quarter to record higher  revenues  than  the  fiscal  year's  first  period.  The  Company  believes  that  this  seasonality results from several factors, including but not limited to the following:

- final  clients  whose  fiscal  year  ends  on  December  31  and  who  choose  to  spend  the remaining unused portions of their available budgets until the end of the fiscal year;
- seasonal reductions in commercial activity in July and August in the United States, Europe, and certain other regions, which could result in a negative impact on the Issuer's revenues; and
- the final client's budget planning at the beginning of the calendar year, which may lead to a delay in spending in the first part of the year, negatively impacting the Issuer's revenue in the first part of the fiscal year,

As the Issuer continues to develop, seasonal or cyclical variations in its operations may become more  pronounced,  and  the  Issuer's  business,  operating  results,  and  financial  position  may  be adversely affected.

## If the Issuer fails to hire, integrate, train, retain, and incentivize qualified personnel and the Company's senior management, its business may suffer

The Issuer's future success depends, in part, on its ability to continue to hire, integrate, train, and retain  qualified  and  highly  skilled  personnel.  The  Issuer  is  substantially  dependent  on  the continued services of existing personnel, primarily due to the complexity of the Issuer's product and service offering. In addition, any failure to adequately hire, onboard, train and incentivize sales personnel,  or  the  inability  of  newly  hired  sales  personnel  to  effectively  achieve  targeted productivity  levels,  could  adversely  impact  the  growth  and  margin  operations  of  the  Issuer. Competition for highly qualified personnel, particularly in engineering, is often intense, especially in Bucharest, where the Issuer has a substantial presence and need for such personnel.

In  addition,  the  industry  in  which  the  Issuer  operates  generally  experiences  high  employee attrition.  If  the  Issuer  cannot  hire,  integrate,  train,  or  retain  the  qualified  and  highly  qualified personnel  necessary  to  meet  its  current  or  future  needs,  its  business,  financial  condition,  and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The Issuer's future performance also depends on the continued services and contributions of the Issuer's management to execute the business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of the services provided by these persons, the decrease in the efficiency of these services, or the ineffective management of any transition at the management level,  could significantly delay or prevent the realization of the development plan, which could adversely affect the activity, financial situation and operational results of the Issuer.

<!-- image -->

Flaws, errors, or vulnerabilities in the Issuer's products and services, failure of the products or services it provides to block a virus or to prevent a security incident, misuse of the Issuer's products and services it offers or product and service liability claims may harm the Issuer's reputation and negatively impact operating results

Because the products and services that the Issuer sells and/or delivers are complex, they may contain design flaws or errors that are not detected until after they are released and implemented by end customers. End customers can report product and service defects related to performance, scalability, and compatibility. In addition, the flaws may make the products or services that the Issuer sells and/or delivers vulnerable to security attacks, may not contribute to the security of networks or may lead to the temporary interruption of end clients' network traffic. Because the techniques used by hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, the Issuer may not be able to anticipate these techniques and provide a real-time solution to protect end-client networks.

In addition, as an established cybersecurity provider, the Issuer's solutions, networks, and products could be targeted by attacks designed to disrupt its business and damage its reputation. Also, defects or errors in product updates or services delivered could cause those services to fail. The Issuer's  data  centers  and  networks  may  experience  technical  failures  and  downtime,  fail  to distribute appropriate updates, or fail to meet the increased demands of a growing installed base of end clients.

Moreover, the Issuer's products and services must coexist with end clients' existing infrastructure, which often has different specifications, use  multiple  protocol standards,  implement  products from numerous vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it can be challenging to identify the sources of those problems.

The occurrence of any such problem in the products and services that the Issuer sells and/or delivers, whether real or perceived, could result in the following:

- redirecting significant financial and product development resources to efforts to analyze, correct or eliminate errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;
- loss of existing or potential end clients or partners;
- delayed or lost revenue;
- delay or failure to obtain market acceptance of delivered products and services;
- an increase in warranty claims compared to historical experience or an increased cost of warranty claims, either of which adversely affects gross margins; and
- litigation or investigations, each of which could be costly or reputational,

The provisions regarding the limitation of liability in the standard terms and conditions of sale may not  fully  or  effectively  protect  the  Issuer  from  claims  resulting  from  governmental  laws  or ordinances, local regulations, or adverse judicial decisions in Romania or other countries.

If the Issuer does  not  accurately anticipate,  prepare  for  and  promptly  respond  to technological and market developments and successfully manage the market introduction and transition to new products and services to meet the changing needs of end clients in the field of cybersecurity, the competitive position and its prospects will be affected

The cybersecurity field has grown rapidly and is expected to evolve rapidly. Moreover, most of the Issuer's  clients  operate  in  markets  characterized  by  continuously  changing  technologies  and

<!-- image -->

business  plans,  which  require  them  to  add  numerous  network  access  points  and  adapt  their increasingly complex business networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software, operating systems, and network protocols. For this reason, the Issuer must continuously adapt its products and/or services,

In addition, the Issuer must commit significant resources to develop new features and new ways of cloud, AI, and other security before knowing whether its investments will result in products and services  that  the  market  will  accept.  The  success  of  new  features  depends  on  several  factors, including properly defining the latest products, differentiating the new products, services, and features from those of the Issuer's competitors, and market acceptance of those products, services, and features. Moreover, the successful introduction and transition of new products depend on several factors, including the Issuer's ability to manage the risks associated with issues related to the  acceleration  of  new  product  production,  the  availability  of  software  applications  for  new products, the effective management of commitments purchasing and inventory, the availability of products in adequate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products  may  have  quality  or  other  defects  or  deficiencies,  particularly  in  the  early  stages  of introduction.

## The Issuer's current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or services that result in significant revenue, cost savings, or other benefits in the foreseeable future

The development of products and services related to the Issuer's activity is an expensive process. The Issuer's investments in research and development may not result in significant improvements, marketable products or services, or may result in products or services that are more expensive than anticipated. In addition, the Issuer may not realize the expected cost savings or performance improvements it had anticipated (it may take more time to generate revenue). The Issuer's plans include significant  investments in research and development. The Issuer believes that it must continue to devote a substantial number of resources to its research and development efforts in order to maintain its competitive position. However, the Issuer may not experience significant revenue  from  these  investments  in  the  near  future,  or  these  investments  may  not  yield  the expected benefits, which could adversely affect its business and operating results.

## LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS

## Changes in tax laws or interpretations, as well as unfavorable decisions by tax authorities, may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's results of operations and cash flows

Tax laws and regulations in Romania may be subject to change, and there may be changes in the interpretation  and  application  of  tax  legislation.  These  changes  in  tax  legislation  and/or  the interpretation  and  application  of  tax  law  may  be  rapidly  adopted/applied  by  the  authorities, challenging to anticipate. Therefore, the Issuer may not be prepared for these changes. As a result, it is possible that the Issuer may face increases in due taxes in the event of changes in tax rates or if tax laws or regulations are amended by the relevant authorities in a manner that disadvantages the Issuer, which may have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition for any affected reporting period.

## Risk associated with litigation

In the context of the performance of its activity, the Issuer is subject to a risk of litigation, among others,  due  to  changes  and  developments  in  legislation.  The  Issuer  may  be  affected  by  other contractual  claims,  complaints,  and  litigation,  including  from  third  parties  with  whom  it  has contractual  relationships,  clients,  competitors,  or  regulatory  authorities,  as  well  as  any  adverse publicity that such an event attracts.

At the time of drawing up this report, the Issuer SAFETECH INNOVATIONS SA was not involved in any litigation in an active or passive procedural capacity.

## RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN ROMANIA

## Political and military instability in the region may have negative consequences on the Issuer's business

The political and military instability in the region, determined by the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation in February 2022, preceded by the loss of control over the Crimean Peninsula in favor of the Russian Federation and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine with pro-Russian separatists in 2014, as well as the international sanctions imposed on the Federation Russians as a result of these events, may cause deeply unfavorable economic conditions, social unrest or, in the worst case, extensive military confrontations in the region. The effects are largely unpredictable and may include  a  decline  in  investment,  significant  currency  fluctuations,  increases  in  interest  rates, reduced availability of credit, trade, and capital flows, increases in energy prices, etc.

Also, the recent conflict in the Middle East, especially Israel, recognized as an international center for IT services and products, may further fuel global economic and trade uncertainties.

These  effects,  as  well  as  other  unforeseen  adverse  effects  of  crises  in  the  region,  may  have significant negative consequences on the activity, prospects, results of operations, and financial position of the Issuer.

## The upward trend of the inflation rate may produce significant negative consequences on the Issuer's financial performance

The  unpredictability  of  the  inflation  rate  can  have  adverse  effects  on  the  Issuer's  activity  by increasing the difficulty of the Issuer's estimation of the total costs related to the activities carried out  by  it  and  the  creation  of  a  potential  mismatch  between  the  prices  charged  by  the  Issuer concerning  its  clients  and  the  Issuer's  costs,  with  a  significant  adverse  effect.  An  essential difference between the expected inflation rate in a certain period and the value actually recorded in that period can significantly negatively influence the way the Issuer's resources are allocated, thus influencing its activity, financial availability, prospects, and profitability.

Moreover,  an unpredictable  increase in the inflation rate can  bring imbalances  at the macroeconomic level, characterized by the increase in interest rates, the decrease in the standard of  living,  and,  in  general,  the  slowdown  of  the  development  of  the  economy  in  Romania, imbalances that can contribute to the decline in demand in the cybersecurity field.

## A potential deterioration of the general economic, political, and social conditions in Romania may have adverse effects on the Issuer's activity

The Issuer's  success  is  closely  linked  to  the  general  economic  developments  in  Romania.  The adverse  outcomes  or  the  general  weakening  of  the  Romanian  economy,  the  decrease  in  the standard  of  living,  the  limited  liquidity  resources  of  potential  clients,  and  the  increase  in  the unemployment level could have a direct negative impact on the demand in the cybersecurity market in Romania.

Romania has undergone far-reaching political, economic, and social changes in recent years. As expected, emerging markets do not possess the complete business infrastructure and legal and regulatory  framework  that  generally  exists  in  more  mature  free  market  economies.  Also, Romania's tax legislation is subject to multiple, diverse interpretations and may undergo changes frequently and sometimes suddenly or too quickly implemented.

The future direction of Romania's economy remains largely dependent on the effectiveness of the economic,  financial,  and  monetary  measures  adopted  at  the  governmental  level  and  on developments  in  the  fiscal,  legal,  regulatory,  and  political  fields.  The  unfavorable  economic conditions in Romania, fiscal uncertainty, and increased taxation could ultimately have a direct and/or indirect negative impact on the prices charged for the Issuer's products and services.

## The national currency (LEI) can be subject to high volatility

The national currency is subject to a variable exchange rate regime, whereby its value against foreign currencies is established on the interbank exchange market. The monetary policy of the NBR targets inflation. The variable exchange rate regime is aligned with the use of inflation targets as  the  nominal  anchor  of  the  monetary  policy  and  allows  for  a  flexible  policy  response  to unforeseen shocks that might affect the economy. The NBR does not consider a specific level or range  for  the  exchange  rate.  The  NBR's  ability  to  limit  the  volatility  of  the  national  currency depends on several economic and political factors, including the availability of foreign currency reserves and the volume of new foreign direct investment.

Any changes in global investors' perceptions of the international or Romania's economic prospects may  lead  to  the  depreciation  of  the  Romanian  currency.  A  significant  devaluation  of  it  may adversely  affect  the  economic  and  financial  situation  of  the  country,  which  could  have  a substantial adverse effect on the Issuer's business, operating results, and financial condition.

## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.1 Declaration of conformity

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Order of the Minister of Finance no. 2844/2016 for the approval of accounting regulations in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  ('OMFP  no.  2844/2016'). According  to  OMFP  no.  2844/2016,  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  are  the standards adopted in accordance with the procedures of European Commission Regulation no. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards (IFRS).

These provisions are in accordance with the provisions of the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union, with the exception of the provisions of IAS 21 The effects of the variation of exchange rates regarding the functional currency, the provisions of IAS 20  Accounting  for  government  subsidies  regarding  the  recognition  of  income  from  green certificates , with the exception of IFRS 15 - Revenues from contracts with customers regarding the  revenues  from  connection  fees  to  the  distribution  network  and  with  the  exception  of  the treatment of interim distribution of dividends.

For  the  purpose  of  drawing  up  these  financial  statements,  in  accordance  with  the  legislative provisions  in  Romania,  the  functional  currency  of  the  Company  is  considered  to  be  the Romanian Leu (RON).

Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the normal  course  of  a  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement  date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a another evaluation technique.  In  estimating  the  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  liability,  the  Company  considers  the characteristics of the asset or liability in the market that participants would consider when pricing the  asset  or  liability  at  the  measurement  date.  Fair  value  for  measurement  and/or  disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of of IFRS 16 and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realizable value in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The main accounting policies adopted are presented below.

## 2.2 Going concern

The present financial statements were drawn up based on the principle of continuity of activity, which assumes that the Company will continue its activity in the foreseeable future. To assess the applicability of this assumption, management analyzes forecasts of future cash inflows.

On  December  31,  2024,  the  Company's  current  assets  exceed  current  liabilities  by  RON 1.016.756 (on December 31, 2023, current assets exceed current liabilities by RON 2.706.319). On the same date, the Company recorded a global result of 13.517.263 RON (2023: 9.738.449 RON).

The  management  considers  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  continue  its  activity  in  the foreseeable future and, therefore, the application of the principle of continuity of activity in the preparation of the financial statements is justified.

## 2.3 Adoption for the first time of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 1)

The  Company  adopted  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  for  the  first  time  on December 31, 2021. Therefore, the Company restated the financial position  for two  previous years, 2019 and 2020, previously reported in accordance with Order No. 1802 of December 29, 2014  -  Part  I  for  the  approval  of  the  Accounting  Regulations  on  individual  annual  financial statements and consolidated annual financial statements (GAAP).

Consequently, the first financial statements of the Company included:

- three financial position statements
- three statements of profit or loss and other elements of the comprehensive result
- three cash flow statements
- three statements of changes in equity and
- related notes, including comparative information as set forth below.

## 2.4 Significant accounting policies

The  accounting  policies  for  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  have  been  applied consistently by the Company.

The Company has also adopted the Presentation of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and Statement of IFRS Practice 2) effective January 1, 2023. Although the amendments did not result  in  changes  to  accounting  policies,  they  affected  the  information  regarding  accounting policies  presented  in  the  financial  statements.  The  amendments  require  the  presentation  of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on  the  application  of  materiality  in  the  presentation  of  accounting  policies,  helping  entities  to provide useful, entity-specific information that users need to understand other information in the financial statements.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

Management  has  reviewed  the  changes  regarding  the  application  of  materiality  in  the presentation  of  significant  accounting  policies,  and  the  information  is  consistent  with  the significant accounting policies of the previous reporting period.

The significant  accounting  policies  applied  by  the  Company  in  the  preparation  of  its  financial statements are described below:

## ➢ Currency conversions

The  Company's  financial  statements  are  presented  in  RON,  which  is  also  the  functional currency.

Foreign currency transactions are converted into RON using the exchange rate valid on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency at the end of the period  are  valued  in  RON  using  the  exchange  rate  valid  at  the  end  of  the  financial  year. Realized  or  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  the  profit  and  loss  account.  The exchange rate was as follows:

| Date             | Euro   |        |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| 31 December 2023 | 4,9746 | 4,4958 |
| 31 December 2024 | 4,9741 | 4,7768 |

Exchange rate differences, favorable or unfavorable, between the exchange rate from the date of recording the receivables or liabilities in foreign currency or the exchange rate at which they were reported in the previous financial statements and the exchange rate from the date of the end of the financial year, are recorded under financial income or expenses, as the case.

## IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers

IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers establishes a five-step model for recognizing and recording revenue resulting  from  contracts with  customers. In  accordance  with  IFRS  15, revenue is recognized in the amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to the customer.

## Sales of goods

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods. The company delivers goods under contractual conditions based on internationally accepted delivery conditions. The moment when the customer obtains control of the assets is considered to be substantially the same for most of the Company's contracts under IFRS 15. The Company believes that revenue should be recognized when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery of the goods.

## Revenue recognition from distinct performance obligations

The company analyzed its contracts with customers to determine all its performance obligations, and did not identify any new performance obligations that should be accounted for separately in accordance with IFRS 15.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The company provides monitoring, support and audit services regarding information security as its main activity. Income is valued at the expected value of the consideration received or to be received. In accordance with IFRS 15, the total consideration from service contracts is allocated to  all  services  based  on  their  individual  selling  prices.  Individual  sales  prices  are  established based  on  the  list  prices  at  which  the  Company  provides  the  respective  services  in  separate transactions. Based on the Company's assessment, the value allocated based on the relative individual selling prices of the services and the individual selling prices of the services are largely similar. Therefore, the application of IFRS 15 does not result in significant differences regarding the timing of revenue recognition for these services.

Equipment maintenance - Included in the transaction price for the sale of equipment is an aftersales service.

This service refers to maintenance work that may be required to be performed on the equipment for a period of one to three years after sale. This period can then be extended if the customer requires additional years of maintenance services. Renewal of services after the three-year period will be for the price at which they are sold by the Company to all its customers on the date of renewal, regardless of the existence of a renewal option. Accordingly, the option to extend the renewal period does not provide any benefit to customers when they terminate the initial contract, and therefore no revenue has been deferred related to this renewal option. The maintenance service is considered to be a distinct service because it is regularly provided by the Company to other customers independently and is available to customers from other providers in the market. Therefore, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to maintenance services based on the stand-alone selling price of those services. Revenues related to maintenance services are recognized over time. The transaction price allocated to these services is recognized as a contract liability at the time of the initial sales transaction and is amortized on a straight-line basis  over  the  service  period  (ie,  one to  three  years  when  the  services  are  purchased together with the underlying equipment).

The recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 15 are also applicable to the recognition and measurement of any gains or losses resulting from the disposal of non-financial assets (such as fixed assets and intangible assets), when this disposal is not in the normal course of business. However, upon transition, the effect of these changes is not significant for the Company.

## Variable consideration

Some contracts with customers include trade price discounts or the right of return for quality defects. Currently, the revenues obtained from these sales are recognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of revenue reductions, commercial discounts recorded under accrual accounting when a reasonable estimate of revenue adjustments can be made.

According to IFRS 15, it is necessary to estimate the variable consideration at the beginning of the contract. Revenues are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the value of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. Consequently, for those contracts  for  which  the  Company  is  unable  to  make  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  discounts,  the income is recognized earlier than when the return period passes or when a reasonable estimate can be made. In order to estimate the variable consideration to which it would be entitled, the Company applied the expected value method. At the same time, the cases of quality complaints (rights of return) are isolated and insignificant, based on information from past periods.

## Considerations related to the action in one's own name and as an intermediary

In accordance with IFRS 15, the assessment is based on the criterion of whether the Company controls the specific goods before transferring them to the end customer, rather than whether it has exposure to significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods.

The  company  concluded  that  it  acts  in  its  own  name  in  most  of  the  contractual  sales  relationships, because it is the main provider in all revenue contracts, it has the right to set the price and it is exposed to the risks related to stocks. In the specific case of those contractual arrangements in which the Company does not control the goods before transferring them to the final customer, it has the capacity of an intermediary.

## IFRS 9 Financial instruments

## Financial assets

The  financial  assets  of  the  Company  are  represented  by  trade  receivables  and  other  receivables, cash and cash equivalents.

Initial recognition: The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the Company's business model regarding their management. With the exception of commercial receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical method, the Company initially evaluates a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not evaluated at fair value, through profit or loss transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical cost are valued at the transaction price determined according to IFRS 15.

Subsequent  evaluation:  The  company  measures  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  if  the following conditions are cumulatively met:

- i) The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and;
2. ii) The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise at the specified dates to cash flows that represent exclusively payments of principal and interest from the principal amount in circulation (SPPI).

Financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  are  subsequently  valued  based  on  the  effective  interest method (EIR) and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or depreciated.

Derecognition: A financial asset (or, if applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:

- i) The rights to receive cash flows arising from the asset have expired;
2. ii) The company transferred its rights to receive the cash flows arising from the asset or assumed an obligation to pay the cash flows collected in full, without significant delays, to a third party, based on a commitment with identical flows; and (a) the Company has tran-

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

- sferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or (b) the Company has not transferred  and  retained  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset,  but  has transferred control over the asset;
- iii)  The company has transferred its rights to receive the cash flows from an asset or entered into a commitment with identical flows and has neither transferred nor retained significantly all the risks and rewards related to the asset, but neither has transferred control over the  asset,  the  asset  is  recognized  proportionally  to  the  continuation  of  the  Company's involvement in the respective asset. In this case, the Company also recognizes an associated debt.
- iv)  The transferred asset and the associated debt are evaluated on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. The continuation of the involvement that takes the form of a guarantee regarding the transferred asset is evaluated at the lower value between the initial accounting value of the asset and the maximum value of the consideration that could be imposed on the Company to reimburse it.

Impairment of financial assets: The Company recognizes a provision for expected credit losses for all financial assets attached to liabilities that are not held at fair value through profit or loss. For  trade  receivables  and  contractual  assets,  the  Company  applies  a  simplified  approach  in calculating expected losses. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but recognizes, instead, a provision based on the expected lifetime loss data at each reporting date. The  company  analyzes  the  receivables  individually  and  takes  into  account  the  effect  of  the financial  guarantees  received  from  the  insurers  in  the  calculation  of  expected  losses  from lending. For more information, see Note 12 - Trade receivables and other receivables.

## Financial debts

Initial  recognition:  Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through profit or loss, loans and credits or derivatives designated as hedging instruments within an effective hedge, as the case may be. The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities upon initial recognition.

Subsequent evaluation: The company evaluates financial debts according to their classification,

## as follows:

- i) Loans and credits: interest-bearing loans are subsequently evaluated at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognized in the profit and loss account when debts are derecognized, as well as during the amortization process at the effective interest rate. The amortized cost is calculated taking into account any discount or purchase premium and any commissions and costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective interest rate is included in the profit and loss account at financing costs.
2. ii) Financial guarantee contracts: The company initially recognizes financial guarantee contracts as a debt at fair value, adjusted to the costs related to the transaction that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the debt is valued at the higher value of the best estimate of the expenditure necessary to settle the obligation present at the reporting date and the recognized value minus accumulated depreciation.

Derecognition: The company derecognizes a financial debt when the obligation  related to the debt is extinguished, is canceled or expires. If a financial debt is replaced by another debt from

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards the  same  creditor  under  substantially  different  conditions,  or  if  the  terms  of  an  existing  debt change substantially, this exchange or change is treated as a derecognition of the original debt and a recognition of new debts. The difference between the related accounting values is recognized in the profit and loss account.

## Clearing of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net value reported in the statement of financial position only if there is currently both a legal right to offset the recognized amounts and an  intention  to  settle  on  a  net  basis  or  to  capitalize  the  assets  and  settle  the  debts simultaneously.

## Interest income

The interest income generated by a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the Company  will  obtain  economic  benefits  and  when  that  income  can  be  reliably  measured. Interest  income  is  accumulated  over  time,  by  reference  to  the  principal  and  the  applicable effective interest rate, i.e. the rate that exactly updates the estimated future cash receipts over the  anticipated  period  of  the  financial  asset  to  the  net  book  value  of  the  asset  at  the  date  of initial  recognition.  Interest  income  is  included  in  the  profit  and  loss  account  under  financial income.

## Tax

## Current profit tax

Current income tax receivables and payables for the current period are valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and fiscal laws used to calculate the amounts are those adopted or to a large extent adopted at the reporting date by Romanian legislation.

The current profit tax related to the elements recognized directly in equity is recognized directly in  equity,  not  in  the  profit  and  loss  account.  The  management  periodically  evaluates  the positions presented in the fiscal declarations regarding the situations in which the applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and constitute provisions if necessary.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax is presented applying the variable ratio method regarding the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their accounting value for the purpose of financial reporting at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, unless:

- i) The deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or a net asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the date of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss ;

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

- ii) Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credit carryforwards and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and credit carryforwards can be utilised. unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, unless;
- iii) The deferred tax asset related to deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the date of the transaction, does not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of the deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow recovery of the deferred tax asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rates expected to be applied for the period in which the asset is realized or the debt is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that have been adopted or to a large extent adopted up to reporting date.

Deferred tax on items recognized outside profit and loss is recognized outside profit and loss. The elements regarding the deferred tax are recognized in correlation with the transaction supporting other elements of the global result or directly in the equity.

Deferred tax receivables and liabilities are offset if there is a legal right to offset current tax receivables with current profit tax liabilities and deferred taxes refer to the same taxable entity and the same fiscal authority.

## VAT

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognized net of VAT, except for:

- The case in which the sales tax applicable to the purchase of assets or services is not recoverable, in this case the sales tax being recognized as part of the asset acquisition cost or as part of the expense element, as the case may be;
- Receivables and payables presented at a value including sales tax.

The  net  value  of  the  sales  tax  recoverable  from  or  paid  to  ANAF  is  included  as  part  of receivables and payables in the statement of financial position.

## Tangible assets

## Initial assessment

Tangible assets are valued at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if applicable.

This cost includes the replacement cost of the respective tangible fixed asset at the time of replacement and the cost of borrowing for long-term construction projects, if the recognition criteria are met.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

When significant parts of tangible assets must be replaced at certain intervals, the Company recognizes the respective parts as individual assets with a specific useful life and depreciates them accordingly. Also, when carrying out a general inspection, its cost is recognized in the accounting value of tangible assets as a replacement, if the recognition criteria are met. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the profit and loss account when incurred. The present value of the expected costs for scrapping the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the criteria for recognizing a provision are met.

The cost of a tangible asset consists of:

- its  purchase  price,  including  customs  duties  and  non-refundable  purchase  taxes,  after deducting trade discounts and rebates;
- any costs that can be directly attributed to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to function in the manner desired by management;
- the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and moving the element and rehabilitating the location where it is located, the obligation that the entity bears when acquiring the element or as a consequence of using the element for a certain period for purposes other than those of producing stocks during that period.

## Subsequent evaluation

Fixed assets are valued at historical cost from which amortization and possible adjustments for depreciation are deducted.

## Depreciation of fixed assets

Depreciation is calculated using:

- the linear method for buildings and equipment that are not related to production capacity
- the accelerated method for fixed assets representing equipment that are related to the
- production capacity- in accordance with OG 101/2020

## Useful life

The period of economic use is the period of time in which the asset is expected to be used by a company. The economic useful life for tangible assets was determined by specialized employees. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line or accelerated method, over the entire useful life of the asset.

The average lifetimes by category of fixed assets are as follows:

|                             | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Fixed assets for production | 2-8     |
| Transport vehicles          | 6       |

An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  derecognised  on  disposal  or  when  no  future economic benefits  are  expected  from  its  use  or  disposal. Any  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the derecognition of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds on disposal

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the accounting value of the item) is included in the profit and loss account when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, lifetimes and depreciation methods of fixed assets are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted accordingly.

## ➢ Leasing

The company evaluates whether a contract is or includes a leasing contract, at the initiation of the contract, that is, if that contract grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.

## The company as lessee

The company applies a single recognition and valuation approach for all leasing contracts, except for short-term leasing contracts and leasing contracts for which the underlying asset has a low value. The company recognizes leasing liabilities for making lease payments and right-ofuse assets that represent the right to use the underlying assets.

## Right-of-use assets

The company recognizes a right-of-use asset on the date the lease contract commences (ie the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are valued at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any revaluation of lease liabilities. The cost of the asset related to the right of use includes the value of the initial evaluation  of  the  rent  liability,  the  initial  direct  costs  incurred  and  the  related  rent  payments made on or before the start date of the development, less the incentives received under the rental contract.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the assets, as follows:

- Buildings

8 years

The right-of-use asset is also subject to impairment in accordance with the policy for impairment of non-financial assets described below.

## Lease liabilities

On the date of commencement of the leasing contract, the Company recognizes the leasing debt at the updated value of the leasing payments that must be made during the duration of the leasing contract. Lease payments include fixed payments (including fixed payments in the fund) less any lease incentives to be received, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and amounts expected to be paid based on residual value guarantees. Leasing payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option, if the Company has reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option, as well as the payment of the penalties for terminating the leasing contract, if the duration of the leasing contract reflects the Company's exercise of a termination

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards options. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or context that triggers this payment occurs.

When calculating the updated value of the leasing payments, the Company uses the marginal loan  rate  from  the  start  date  of  the  leasing  contract,  if  the  implicit  interest  rate  in  the  leasing contract cannot be determined immediately. After the start date, the value of the lease liabilities is  increased to reflect the interest and reduced by the value of the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is reassessed if there is a change, a change in the lease term, a change in lease payments (for example, changes in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used for determining those payments) or a change in the valuation of a call option on the underlying asset.

## ➢ Intangible assets

Separately acquired intangible assets are valued at initial recognition at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Internally  generated  intangible  assets,  excluding  capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the expense is reflected in the profit and loss account at the time the expense is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as determinable.

Intangible assets with a determined useful life are amortized over their economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there are indications of impairment of the intangible asset. The amortization period and amortization method for an intangible asset with a definite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful lives or in the expected rate of consumption of the future economic benefits incorporated in the assets are accounted for by changing the method or the amortization period, as the case may be, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The expense of amortization of intangible assets with a useful life is recognized in the profit and loss account in the expense category in accordance with the function of intangible assets.

|                                   | Years   |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Computer programs                 | 2-3     |
| Research and development expenses | 5       |

5

Gains or losses resulting from the derecognition of an intangible asset are calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the accounting value of the item and is recognized in the profit and loss account when the asset is derecognised.

## Research and development expenses

Research costs are recognized as an expense when incurred. The expenses related to the development of an individual project are recognized as intangible assets when the Company can demonstrate:

- The technical feasibility required to complete the intangible asset so that it is available for use or sale;

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

- His intention to complete the intangible asset and the ability to use or sell it;
- The way in which the intangible immobilization will generate future economic benefits;
- Availability of resources to complete the immobilization;
- Its ability to reliably evaluate the expenses during the development of the immobilization.

After the initial recognition of the development expense of an asset, the cost model is applied, which provides for the accounting of assets at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation of fixed assets begins when the development is completed and the asset is available for sale/use. It is amortized over the period of the expected future  benefit.  Depreciation  is  recognized  in  the  cost  of  goods  sold.  During  the  development period, the asset is tested annually for impairment.

## Patents, licenses, trademarks

Patents, licenses, trademarks are recognized as intangible assets and evaluated according to the useful life period (definite - amortized, indefinite period - tested for impairment).

## Derecognition of intangible assets

An  intangible  asset  is  derecognized  upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected  from  its  use  or  disposal.  Gains  or  losses  resulting  from  the  derecognition  of  an intangible asset, assessed as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the net book value of the asset, are recognized in profit and loss when the asset is recognisable.

## ➢ Government subsidies

Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will  comply  with  the  related  conditions  and  that  the  grants  will  be  received.  Government subsidies are recognized in profit or loss systematically over the periods in which the Company recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the subsidies are intended to compensate. Specifically,  government  grants  whose  main  condition  is  that  the  Company  purchases, constructs or otherwise acquires fixed assets (including tangible and intangible fixed assets) are recognized  as  deferred  income  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  and transferred to profit or loss for a period. Systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the related assets.

Government subsidies that are to be received as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred  or  for  the  purpose  of  providing  immediate  financial  support  to  the  Company,  without related  future  costs,  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  become receivable.

## ➢ Inventories

The main categories of stocks are raw materials, goods and consumables.

The cost of stocks  includes  all  purchase  expenses,  production  costs  (including  all  direct  and indirect  costs  attributable  to  the  operational  activity  of  production)  and other  costs  incurred  in bringing the stocks to their current state and location.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the  estimated  selling  price  under  the  conditions  of  normal  operation  of  the  business  less  the estimated costs of completion and selling costs.

At the end of management, stocks are valued based on the FIFO method.

The company periodically inventories the stocks to determine if they are damaged, obsolete, have slow movement or if the net realizable value has decreased, and makes the necessary adjustments.

## ➢ Depreciation of non-financial assets

The company evaluates at each reporting date if there are indications of impairment of an asset. If there are indications or if an annual impairment test is necessary for an asset, the Company estimates the recoverable value of that asset. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the fair value of an asset (or cash-generating unit) minus the costs associated with the sale and  its  value  in  use.  This  is  determined  for  an  individual  asset,  unless  the  asset  does  not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those of other assets or groups of assets. When the book value of an asset or cash-generating unit is greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and its book value is reduced to its recoverable amount.

In case of internally developed software, the first step in the analysis for the depreciation is that the ROA for the year (value of the realised revenuegenerated) should not be less than 20% of the net asset value at the year end. If the value of the generated income is less than 20%, the method mentioned below is used. In case generated revenue exceeds 20%, then there is no need to adjust for depreciation.

When assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and asset-specific risks. When determining the fair value minus the costs associated with the sale, recent market transactions are taken into account, if any. If such transactions cannot be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

The loss from the depreciation of continuing activities, including the depreciation of stocks, is recognized in the profit and loss account in the expense category consistent with the function of the depreciated asset, except for a property that was previously revalued and the revaluation was accounted for in other elements of the comprehensive result. In this case, the impairment is also  recognized  in  other  elements  of  the  overall  result  up  to  the  value  of  any  previous revaluation.

In  each  reporting  period,  an  assessment  is  made  to  determine  if  there  are  indicators  that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If there is such an indication, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the asset or the treasury generating unit. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount. The reversal is limited, so that the accounting value of the asset does not exceed its recoverable value and does not exceed the accounting value that the asset would have had if it had not been previously depreciated. Such reversal is recognized in the profit and loss account unless the asset has been revalued, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

## ➢ Cash and short-term deposits

Cash and short-term deposits from the statement of financial position include cash at home and at banks and short-term deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less.

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are made up of cash and short-term deposits defined above, net of outstanding overdrafts.

## ➢ Provisions

## General

Provisions  are  recognized  when  the  Company  has  a  current  obligation  (legal  or  implied) generated by a previous event, it is likely that an outflow of resources incorporating economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the value of the obligation can be reliably estimated.  If  the  Company  expects  that  a  provision  will  be  fully  or  partially  reimbursed,  for example,  based  on  an  insurance  contract,  the  reimbursement  is  recognized  as  a  separate asset, but only if the reimbursement is almost certain. The related expense of any provision is presented in the profit and loss account, net of any reimbursement.

Provisions  are  reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  and  adjusted  to  reflect  management's current best estimate in this regard. If an outflow of resources is no longer likely to settle an obligation, the provision must be canceled by resuming income.

## Provisions for litigation

Litigation provisions are recognized when management estimates probable cash outflows as a result of unfavorable litigation.

## ➢ Pensions and other post-employment benefits

As part of its current activity, the Company makes payments to the Romanian state on behalf of its  employees  for  post-employment  (retirement)  benefits.  All  employees  of  the  company  are included in the pension plan of the Romanian State. The company does not operate any other pension  scheme  and,  consequently,  has  no  obligation  regarding  pensions.  In  addition,  the Company has no obligation to provide additional benefits to former or current employees.

## ➢ Related parties

The  parties are considered related when  one  of  them  has  the  ability to significantly control/influence the other party, through ownership, contractual rights, family relationships or by other  means.  Related  parties  also  include  the  Company's  principal  owners,  members  of management,  board  members  and  members  of  their  families,  parties  with  which  they  jointly control other companies, post-employment benefit plans for the Company's employees.

## ➢ Retained earnings

The distribution of the profit is carried out accordingly in the following financial year, after the approval  of  the  distribution  in  the  General  Meeting  of  Shareholders,  eg:  the  value  of  the approved dividends and other reserves according to legal regulations.

## 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS

The  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial  statements  requires  the  management  to  make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values for revenues, expenses, assets  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  the  presented  information  that  accompanies  them,  and  to present  the  contingent  liabilities  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  However,  the  existing uncertainty  related  to  these  estimates  and  assumptions  could  result  in  a  significant  future adjustment of the accounting value of the affected asset or liability in future periods. Estimates and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  other  factors  that  are deemed relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The underlying estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The  following  are  the  critical  judgments,  other  than  those  involving  estimates  (which  are presented separately below), that the Company's management made in the process of applying the  Company's  accounting  policies  and  which  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  amounts recognized in the financial statements.

## Judgments

During  the  application  of  the  Company's  accounting  policies,  the  management  made  the following  considerations,  which  have  the  greatest  effect  on  the  amounts  recognized  in  the financial statements:

- Reasoning in determining the fulfillment of enforcement obligations

In making their judgment, the directors have considered the detailed revenue recognition criteria set out in IFRS 15 and, in particular, whether the Company has transferred control of the assets to client. Following the detailed quantification of the Company's  liability regarding the rectification works, and the agreed limitation on the customer's ability to request additional work or  to  request  the  replacement  of  goods,  the  directors  are  satisfied  that  control  has  been transferred and that the recognition of income in the current year is appropriate, together with the recognition of an appropriate warranty provision for rectification costs.

- Reasoning regarding the capitalization of expenses as an intangible asset

In  accordance  with  IAS  38,  the  capitalization  of  expenses  as  intangible  assets  regarding research, start-up costs, pre-exploitation and pre-opening, training, advertising and promotion, moving  and  relocation  previously  recognized  in  GAAP  as  assets  are  de-recognized  in  the position  opening  situation  financial  IFRS.  Following  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  Company's expenses regarding the recognition of intangible assets, the  Company's  management considered that the recognition of assets in the reported period is appropriate.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

During the current year, the Company capitalised development costs of RON 14 million relating to software, on the basis that management considers these costs to be clearly associated with identifiable  products  which  will  be  controlled  by  the  Company  and  have  a  profitable  benefit exceeding the cost beyond one year.

Capitalised costs related to three main software products, as presented in Note 10.

As mentioned above, in capitalising these development costs, management considered that the criteria in IAS 38, Intangible Assets (IAS 38) is met and development expenditure that does not meet the above criteria are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as these are incurred.

## Estimates and assumptions

The main assumptions regarding the future and other important causes of the uncertainty  of estimates  at  the  reporting  date,  which  present  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  significant adjustment  of  the  accounting  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  next  financial  year,  are presented below.

## Taxes, fees and tax provisions

There  are  uncertainties  regarding  the  interpretation  of  complex  fiscal  regulations,  changes  in fiscal legislation and the value and timing of future taxable profit.

All amounts owed to state authorities have been paid or ascertained at the balance sheet date. The  Romanian  fiscal  system  is  undergoing  a  consolidation  process  and  is  in  the  process  of being harmonized with European legislation. Different interpretations may exist at the level of the  tax  authorities  in  relation  to  the  tax  legislation  which  may  lead  to  additional  taxes  and penalties.  If  the  state  authorities  find  fiscal  violations  and  related  regulations,  it  may  lead  to: confiscation of the amounts in the case; additional tax obligations; fines and penalties (which are applied to the outstanding amount). As a result, the tax penalties resulting from the violation of the legal provisions can lead to a significant debt.

At the end of each financial year, the Company makes an estimate of the potential fiscal risks to which it may be subjected and determines the level of potential risk, using the best available estimates,  and  consequently,  if  necessary,  recognizes  a  specific  provision  in  the  financial statements.

## Inventories

Finished products and goods are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The management analyzes the age of the stocks, the expiration date of the products, the quality of the products and possible non-conformity issues, the products that cannot be sold later or that are rejected based on quality problems, and takes into account their implications in determining the net realizable value of the stocks old.

The net realizable value is the sale price under normal business conditions, less completion, marketing and distribution costs, considering the future evolution of sale prices.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The management analyzed the net realizable value of the finished products monthly, taking into account the  selling  prices  of  the  market  as  well  as  the  regulations  specific  to  the  industry  in which it operates.

For the raw materials, specific analyzes are carried out taking into account the age, expiration date, possible quality problems of the elements in the balance.

All assumptions are reviewed annually.

## Provisions for litigation

The company recognizes provisions for litigation related to the risks identified in connection with certain lawsuits pending before the courts, the outcome of which is not certain.

## Useful life for fixed assets and the depreciation method

The company estimates the life spans for the items of tangible assets in accordance with the rate of consumption / wear and tear for the respective assets.

The company considers and uses the following depreciation methods:

- the  linear  method  for  buildings,  fixed  assets  purchased  in  financial  leasing  and  for equipment that are not related to production capacity
- the accelerated method for fixed assets representing equipment that are related to the production capacity

## Sales discounts for estimated returns, price reductions

Returns,  discounts,  incentives  and  rebates  related  to  sales  are  recognized  as  reductions  in turnover,  in  the  period  in  which  the  respective  sales  were  recognized.  These  are  recognized according to commercial offers with monthly, quarterly and annual gross and net value targets. Estimated  unbilled  discounts  are  subject  to  continuous  review  and  appropriate  adjustment based on the latest available information.

## 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## Commitments from financing contracts:

In 2020, the Company concluded a financing contract through the competitiveness operational program  with  the  title:  "Centre  of  excellence  for  cyber  security  and  resilience  of  critical infrastructures" (SafePIC) SMIS Code 2014+:120436, Call Code: POC/222/1/ 3/ Stimulating the demand of enterprises for innovation through CDI projects carried out by enterprises individually

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards or in partnership with CD institutes and universities, in order to innovate processes and products in economic sectors with growth potential (MDR).

In  order  to  advance  the  sustainability  of  the  "Centre  of  excellence  for  cyber  security  and resilience  of  critical  infrastructures  (SafePIC)"  project,  the  management  of  the  company committed to consider the following measures:

- -Looking at supporting ROI, Safetech Innovations has obtained expressions of interest / pre-orders from interested companies, confirming market interest in the product.
- -In preparing the financial forecasts, the principle of prudence was especially taken into account - revenues being estimated in a slightly pessimistic manner;
- -The financial sustainability of the project presupposes its ability to support itself from this point of view (in the worst case assuming the relationship income = expenses). The way in which the activity after the termination of the non-reimbursable financing is conceived and thought also takes into account the obtaining of profit (Revenue-Profit = Expenses). Thus, possible slightly erroneous estimates such as oversized revenues or undersized expenses would not make the company's activity unsustainable, diminishing the estimated profit to begin with.

The company has demonstrated that the enterprise has the ability to generate income from the capitalization of the project results, as well as the ability to cover the operating and maintenance costs after the end of the non-refundable financing, resulting from the commercialization of the products/services/technology obtained from the project, at least during the sustainability period of the 36-month project.

Over the entire analyzed time horizon, the cash flow is positive.

The  applicant's  ability  to  support  itself  financially  in  the  period  after  implementation  is  also supported by the financial results that the company has had from a financial point of view since the  beginning  of  its  establishment,  results  obtained  through  effective  financial  management. Thus,  the  company's  turnover  over  the  period  2011-2014  evolved  from  1,288,644  lei  to 9,115,976 lei, maintaining an upward trend throughout the period.

Considering the overall evolution of the company, the risk that the company will not be able to meet its objectives regarding the expected return on investment is low. From the point of view of technical sustainability, the main objective is to keep the innovative cyber security solution in optimal functional conditions.

The  main  measures  (without  being  the  only  ones  taken)  undertaken  by  the  company's management in this regard are the following:

- -Keeping all staff in the operating team, staff selected on the basis of competence and skills criteria, details given in chapter C of the business plan; for a good performance of the operation stage, the ideal way of working is for the personnel who were involved in the implementation stage to ensure the continuity of the activity during the sustainability period.
- -4 new jobs for qualified personnel in the field of cyber security, covering any current gap in the company in terms of technical requirements;
- -The training of the personnel who will subsequently ensure the maintenance of the product developed through the project, as well as the training of trainers who will ensure the training of the personnel to whom the product is directly addressed;
- -Ensuring continuous training for all members of the operating team;
- -Developing a manual with procedures for using the developed product;
- -Carrying out the technical audit is an additional measure to ensure sustainability from a technical point of view. Considering the measures taken, it can be stated that the sustainability of the results of the project proposed for financing will be supported both admi-

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards nistratively, technically and financially. In addition, the existence of pre-orders and letters of interest confirm the market validation of the product developed by the project.

According  to  both  financing  contracts,  the  Company  has  the  obligation  to  submit  annual Sustainability Reports, after submitting the financial statements to ANAF, for the entire duration of the project, starting with the first calendar year following the year in which the implementation was completed.

Sustainability reports shall contain at least the following types of data and information regarding:

a. changes to the beneficiary's status and identification data;

- b. how and where infrastructures, equipment and assets are used;
- c. how infrastructure investment or productive investment continues to generate results.

According  to  the  financing  agreements,  in  the  case  of  projects  that  include  productive  or infrastructure investments and that are not co-financed from the ESF, the sustainability period of the project is a minimum of 3 years for the beneficiaries in the SME category, respectively a minimum of 5 years  for  the  other  categories  of  beneficiaries  upon  making  the  final  payment under this contract or the period provided for in the state aid regulations, whichever is greater. If  the  project  includes  investments  in  infrastructure  or  production,  the  beneficiary  (unless  the beneficiary  is  an  SME)  has  the  obligation  not  to  relocate  the  production  activity  outside  the European Union, within 10 years of making the final payment. If the contribution from the ESI funds  takes  the  form  of  state  aid,  the  10-year  period  is  replaced  by  the  deadline  applicable according to the rules on state aid.

The sustainability analysis of the project is carried out by the OIC based on the Sustainability Reports  prepared  by  the  beneficiary  and  the  monitoring  visits,  in  order  to  ensure  the sustainability  of  the  projects,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  all  contributions  from  the  funds  are attributed only to projects that, within 3/5 years after their conclusion, were not affected by any change in the category of those stated below, respectively:

- i. a substantial change affecting their nature, objectives or conditions of achievement and which would cause their original objectives to be undermined;
- ii. a change in the ownership of an infrastructure element that gives an unjustified advantage to an enterprise or a public body;
- iii. termination or relocation of a productive activity outside the eligible area

## Other commitments and contingencies:

Tax -All sums owed to the State for fees and taxes have been paid or recorded at the balance sheet date.

The company considers that it has paid on time and in full all the fees, taxes, penalties and penalty interest, to the extent that it is the case.

The Romanian tax authorities did not carry out checks.

In Romania, the fiscal year remains open for checks for a period of 5 years.

Transfer  price  In  accordance  with  the  relevant  tax  legislation,  the  tax  assessment  of  a transaction made with related parties is based on the concept of the market price related to that transaction. Based on this concept, transfer prices must be adjusted to reflect market prices that

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards would have been established between entities that do not have an affiliation relationship and that act independently, based on "normal market conditions".

During  the  reporting  period,  there  were  no  transactions  with  related  parties  and  there  is  a transfer price risk.

The Board of Directors reviews and agrees to the management policies for each of these risks which are briefly presented below.

Business  plan  risk -Safetech  operates  in  what  can  still  be  considered  a  niche  market, especially in Romania. The company aims for sustainable growth, based primarily on legislative changes at the level of the European Union, which will require companies in important sectors of  activity,  such  as  energy,  utilities,  critical  infrastructure  or  in  the  financial-banking  sector,  to implement  strict  security  measures  cybernetics.  However,  in  the  past,  the  entry  into  force  of such laws has been delayed in Romania, and management cannot predict or influence such situations in the future, which may have a direct impact on the realization of forecasts.

Geopolitical Risk - Safetech operates in a globalized market and, therefore, its business and revenues are interdependent on global macroeconomic conditions. International efforts to limit the  spread  of  COVID-19  have  had  a  significant  negative  effect  on  global  macroeconomic conditions,  which  continue  to  cause  economic  uncertainty.  In  addition,  the  military  conflict generated by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, instability in global credit markets, rising prices of essential commodities (oil, electricity, etc.), changes in public policies, such as domestic and international  ones,  such  as  regulations,  taxes  or  international  trade  agreements,  international trade disputes, change of governments, geopolitical unrest and other disruptions to global and regional  economies  and  markets  continue  to  add  uncertainty  to  global  economic  conditions. Management  estimates  that  the  war  currently  does  not  have  an  impact  on  the  financial statements. The long-term impact cannot be predicted, however, at the date of these financial statements,  the  Company  continues  to  meet  its  obligations  as  they  fall  due  and,  therefore, continues to apply the going concern basis of preparation.

Key personnel risk - the success and ability to deliver projects to clients is highly dependent on staff skills, motivation and loyalty. The Romanian IT market is very competitive and there are risks that employees may leave the company. To manage these risks, Safetech has adapted a number of measures: offering a competitive compensation package and promotion opportunities, constant recruitment even when there are no ongoing projects just to be able to always meet the growing demand from customers. In addition, the company actively recruits early-career  IT  specialists,  offering  them  training  and  development  opportunities.  Due  to  this aspect, the share of salaries in the general costs of doing business is the most significant, but this  helps  the  company  to  maintain  its  competitiveness.  However,  it  is  not  guaranteed  that Safetech will always be able to find the necessary number of qualified personnel, especially in the field of ethical hacking, which is highly specific and requires very specific skills.

The  risk  associated  with  making  forecasts -  financial  forecasts  start  from  the  premise  of fulfilling  the  business  development  plan.  The  company  aims  to  periodically  issue  forecasts regarding the evolution of the main economic-financial indicators in order to provide potential investors and the capital market with a true and complete picture of the current situation and the future  plans  envisaged  by  the  company,  as  well  as  current  reports  detailing  the  comparative elements between the forecasted data and the actual results obtained. The forecasts will be part of the annual reports, and the forecasting policy is published on the company's website HERE. Forecasts are made in a prudent manner, but there is a risk of their non-fulfilment, therefore, the

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards data  to  be  reported  by  the  company  may  be  significantly  different  from  those  forecasted  or estimated, as a result of factors  that  were  not previously  foreseen  or whose  negative  impact could not be counteracted or anticipated.

Price  risk -  in  2016,  in  order  to  reduce  price  risk,  the  management  decided  to  change  the business strategy and focus on value-added services to the detriment of the sale of hardware, which  in  previous  years  contributed  a  significant  share  of  revenues,  but  instead  had  a  small profit margin. Thus, since 2017, the company has adjusted its model, focusing on the delivery of value-added services and increasing profitability. Given the nature of Safetech's business, the risk of commoditization of the business, i.e. the risk of the service or technology becoming very widespread and widely adopted, is reduced because the company relies heavily on the skills of its  team of ethical hackers. Since the cost of hiring qualified IT professionals is very high not only in Romania, but also in the whole world, the risk that a competitor could force the company to  lower  the  price  of  services  in  order  to  maintain  its  position  in  the  market  is  relatively  low. However, the management actively monitors the local and international markets to be able to always provide value-added services and maintain a leading position in the local market.

Cash-flow risk - this represents the risk that the company will not be able to honor its payment obligations  when  due.  A  prudent  cash-flow  risk  management  policy  involves  maintaining  a sufficient level of cash,  cash  equivalents  and  financial  availability  through  appropriately contracted credit facilities. The Company monitors the level of forecasted cash inflows from the collection of trade receivables, as well as the level of forecasted cash outflows for the payment of trade and other payables. Thanks to this business model, which includes providing monitoring services for a fixed monthly fee, the company manages to maintain a healthy cash flow.

Credit risk - this is the risk that a third party natural or legal entity will not fulfill its obligations under a financial instrument or under a customer contract, thus leading to a financial loss. The Company  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  from  its  operating  activities  and  its  financial  activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial  instruments.  The  Company  manages  this  risk  by  carefully  selecting  customers  and having  a  strict  procedure  for  documenting  orders  and  the  provision  of  services  or  delivery  of goods.

Liquidity  risk -  liquidity  risk  is  associated  with  holding  immovable  or  financial  assets.  The company's activity does not depend on holding immovable or financial assets and turning them into  liquid  assets.  The  company  does  not  own  any  financial  assets.  The  fixed  assets  of  the company, mainly technological equipment, are used in the current activity of providing services.

Currency risk the possibility of recording losses from international commercial contracts or other economic relationships, due to changes in the exchange rate of the currency in the period between the conclusion of the contract and its maturity. As the company plans to expand into other international markets, from Europe or the US, it will be exposed to this type of risk.

Personal data protection risk - in the course of its business, the company collects, stores and uses  data  that  is  protected  by  personal  data  protection  laws.  Although  the  issuer  takes precautionary  measures  to  protect  customer  data,  in  accordance  with  the  legal  requirements regarding  the  protection  of  privacy,  especially  in  the  context  of  the  implementation  of  the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/79 and in Romania (starting from May 25, 2018) ,  data  leakage  risks  cannot  be  completely  eliminated.  The  Company  considers  this  risk  and takes precautions to protect customer data in accordance with applicable legal requirements. The  Issuer  takes  all  necessary  precautions  in  this  area,  but  there  is  a  possibility  that,

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards considering that it carries out commercial relations with various contractual partners, they may not  fully  comply  with  the  relevant  contractual  terms  and  all  the  data  protection  obligations imposed on them.

Competition  risk  the  entry  of  new  competitors  into  the  market,  especially  from  outside Romania, will intensify competition and put pressure on the company's activity, with the risk of recording a decrease in profit and even its insolvency.

The risk of loss of reputation -  is  a  risk  inherent  in the  company's activity, reputation being particularly  important  in  the  business  environment,  especially  in  its  field  of  activity,  cyber security.  Reputational  risk  is  inherent  in  Safetech's  business.  The  ability  to  retain  and  attract new customers also depends on the recognition of the Safetech brand and its reputation  for service quality in the market. A negative public opinion of the company could result from actual or  perceived  practices  in  the  cybersecurity  market  in  general,  such  as  negligence  during  the provision of services or even the way Safetech conducts or is perceived to conduct its business.

General economic risks - the issuer's activities are sensitive to economic cycles and general economic conditions. Both international financial crises and the unstable economic environment can have significant negative effects on the activity, operational results and financial position of the  issuer.  Socio-political  turmoil  can  also  impact  the  company's  business.  The  international financial markets felt the effects of the global financial crisis that started in 2008. These effects were also felt  on the  Romanian financial  market  in  the form  of the  low liquidity  of  the  capital market, as well as through an increase in medium-term financing interest rates, because of the global liquidity crisis. In the future, such a scenario could be repeated and possible significant losses suffered by the international financial market, with major implications on the local market, could affect the Issuer's ability to obtain new loans or financing, under sustainable conditions.

Pandemic risk -  although  ignored  in  the  last  decades,  this  risk  (especially  the  risk  of  global epidemics, respectively the risk of pandemics) has returned to the public's attention. Although for  some  companies  these  may  become  opportunities,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  the  overall economic impact is considered to be negative. Thus, there are opinions that, depending on the nature and severity of the pandemic, it can induce recessions lasting a quarter, or even several years. In conditions where the reactions of the public authorities and/or the medical community would not be the right ones, there is even a risk of a depression that would lead to important reductions in economic activity and in the price of most assets. For example, in the first months of  2020,  a  coronavirus  pandemic  (SARS-COV-2),  known  as  COVID-19,  emerged.  This pandemic has resulted  in  declines  of  more  than  25%  from  their  most  recent  highs  for  major stock  indices  globally.  This  has  similarly  influenced  the  local  capital  market.  Moreover, internationally, most major asset classes have been severely negatively impacted, even those that traditionally function as havens for investors.

Fiscal and legal risk - the issuer is governed by Romanian legislation and even if Romanian legislation has been largely harmonized with European Union legislation, subsequent changes may  occur,  respectively  new  laws  and  regulations  may  be  introduced,  which  may  produce effects on the company's activity . Legislation in Romania is often unclear, subject to different interpretations and implementations and frequent changes. Both the modification of fiscal and legal  legislation,  as  well  as  possible  events  generated  by  their  application,  can  materialize  in possible fines or lawsuits filed against the company, which can impact the activity of the issuer.

The risk associated with other types of litigation -  in  the  context of the performance of its activity,  the  issuer  is  subject  to  a  risk  of  litigation,  among  others,  as  a  result  of  changes  and

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards development of legislation. The issuer may be affected by other contractual claims, complaints and  litigation, including from  counterparties  with whom  it  has  contractual relationships, customers, competitors or regulatory authorities, as well as any adverse publicity that such an event attracts. At the time of writing this report, Safetech Innovations S.A. was not involved in any litigation in an active or passive procedural capacity.

Risk of garnishment of the issuer's accounts - garnishment is an enforcement measure that can be applied to a company. Thus, the issuer's accounts may be blocked as a result of the seizure, if the issuer's creditors request this measure to recover their claims. The garnishment of the Company's accounts entails the blocking of the amounts in the garnished accounts and may lead to the difficulty or impossibility of the Company to honor its subsequent obligations, in the agreed terms.

Risk associated with insolvency and bankruptcy -  Romanian bankruptcy and enforcement legislation does not offer the same level of rights, remedies and projections enjoyed by creditors under  the  legal  regimes  of  other  European  Union  jurisdictions.  In  particular,  Romanian bankruptcy and enforcement law and practice may make the company's recovery of amounts related  to  secured  and  unsecured  claims  in  Romanian  courts  much  more  difficult  and  timeconsuming compared to other countries.

Risks related to investments in Romania, in an economic and political context - Romania's economy  is  vulnerable  in  conditions  of  regional  or  international  recession,  financial  and economic problems at a general level can be felt more acutely in certain markets or 28 sectors. Also, political and social changes can be an unpredictable factor. Romania does not possess all the business, legal and regulatory infrastructure that would exist in a developed economy. The legislation is subject to varying interpretations and is frequently amended.

Other risks -  potential investors should consider that the risks presented above are the most significant risks of which the company is aware at the time of writing this report. However, the risks  presented  in  this  section  do  not  necessarily  include  all  those  risks  associated  with  the activity of the issuer, and the company cannot guarantee that it includes all relevant risks.

There may be other risk factors and uncertainties of which the company is not aware at the time of writing the report and which may change the actual results, financial conditions, performance and achievements of the issuer in the future and may lead to a decrease in the price of the company's  shares.  Investors  should  also  undertake  the  necessary  due  diligence  in  order  to make their own assessment of the investment opportunity.

Impact on the environment The professional activity of Safetech Innovations has no impact on the  environment.  There  is  no  litigation  and  no  litigation  is  expected  to  arise  related  to environmental protection.

The company is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (mainly currency risk). The Company's  management  oversees  the  management  of  these  risks.  All  activities  related  to derivative financial instruments aimed at managing risks are carried out by teams of specialists who have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Company's policy not to carry out transactions with derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Currency risk -  Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of  changes  in  the  exchange  rate  mainly  refers  to  the  Company's  operating  activities  (when revenues  or  expenses  are  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  Company's  functional currency).

The company has transactions in currencies other than its functional currency (RON).

The exposure to exchange rate risk (mainly due to the EUR and USD currencies) is not significant, so the Company does not use risk hedging instruments.

The detail of financial instruments in foreign currencies is presented as follows (the amounts are expressed in RON equivalent):

|                           | December, 31 2024   | December, 31 2023   |

Assets and liabilities are presented at historical cost except for lease liabilities which are presented at fair value.

## The sensitivity of the currency risk

The sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in the exchange rate of the US dollar and EUR (of 10%), all other variables being kept constant, of the Company's profit before taxation (due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities) is considered by the Company to have in insignificant impact. The Company's exposure to currency changes in any other currencies is not significant.

## Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not fulfill its obligations under a financial instrument or under a customer contract, thus leading to a financial loss. The company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (mainly for trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

## Trade receivables

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards

The  credit  risk  of  customers  is  managed  by  the  Company,  subject  to  the  established  policy; however,  the  Company  considers  that  the  credit  risk  on  the  receivables  is  small.  The receivables balance is monitored at the end of each reporting period and any major delivery to a customer is analysed. Impairment indicators are analyzed at each reporting date. The company assesses the risk concentration regarding trade receivables as low.

## Financial instruments and cash deposits

The  credit  risk  resulting  from  balances  at  banks  and  financial  institutions  is  managed  by  the Company's  treasury department, according to the Company's  policies.  The  Company's maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  for  the  components  of  the  financial  position  statement  is represented by the accounting values illustrated in Note 12.

## Liquidity risk

The company monitors its risk of facing a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool.

On  December  31,  2024,  the  Company  has  no  long-term  financing  (neither  from  commercial partners, nor debts to financial institutions).

## 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.1 Declaration of conformity

The  Group  has  prepared  financial  statements  comprising  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial position, the consolidated statement of income and expenses and other comprehensive income, the consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows  and  the  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  for  the financial year ended December 31, 2024 and notes which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of  the  Order  of  the  Minister  of  Finance  No.  2844/2016  for  the  approval  of  accounting regulations in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('OMFP No. 2844/2016'). According to  OMFP No.  2844/2016, International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  are  the  standards adopted in accordance with the procedures of European Commission Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards (IFRS).

For the purpose of drawing up these financial statements, in accordance with the legislative provisions in Romania, the functional currency of the Group is considered to be the Romanian Leu (RON).

Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the normal course of a transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a another evaluation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company considers the characteristics of the asset or liability in the market that participants would consider when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis,  except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of of IFRS 16 and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realizable value in IAS 2 Inventories or value in use in IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

The main accounting policies adopted are presented below.

## 2.2 Going concern

The present consolidated financial statements were drawn up based on the principle of continuity of activity, which assumes that the Group will continue its activity in the foreseeable future. To assess the applicability of this assumption, management analyzes forecasts of future cash inflows.

The management considers that the Group will be able to continue its activity in the foreseeable future and, therefore, the application of the principle of continuity of activity in the preparation of the financial statements is justified.

## 2.3 Accounting principles, policies and methods

The accounting policies for the preparation of the financial statements have been applied consistently by the Group in 2023 and 2024.

The  Group  has  also  adopted  the  Presentation  of Accounting  Policies  (Amendments  to  IAS  1  and Statement of IFRS Practice 2) effective 1 January 2023. Although the amendments did not result in changes to accounting policies, they affected the information on accounting policies presented in the financial statements. The amendments require the presentation of 'material' rather than 'significant' accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality in the presentation of accounting policies, helping entities to provide useful, entity-specific information that users need to understand other information in the financial statements.

Management  has  reviewed  the  changes  on  the  application  of  materiality  in  the  presentation  of significant accounting policies, and the information is consistent with the significant accounting policies of the previous reporting period.

The following describes the significant accounting policies applied by the Group in preparing its financial statements:

## ➢ The basics of consolidation

The accounting methods and policies mentioned below have been consistently applied by the Group in these financial statements, prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

## ➢ Subsidiaries

When evaluating control, potential or convertible voting rights that can be exercised at present must also be taken into account. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the moment the exercise of control begins until the moment it ceases.

The Group consolidates the financial statements of its subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 10. The list of the Group's subsidiaries is presented in Note 1.

Acquisition of entities under common control

A business combination involving entities under the common control of the ultimate shareholder of the Group is a business combination in which all entities are ultimately controlled by the Group, both before and after the combination, and such control is not transitory.

## ➢ Associated entities

Associated entities are those companies in which the Group can exercise significant influence, but not control over the financial and operational policies. The consolidated financial statements include the group's share of the results of associated entities based on the equity method, from the date on which the group began to exercise significant influence until the date on which this influence ceases.

If the Group's share of the associated entity's losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to zero and subsequent losses are not recognized unless the Group has  legal  or  constructive  obligations  on  behalf  of  the  associated  entity.  If  the  associated  entity subsequently makes a profit, the recognition of the share of the profits will be made only after the share of the profit reaches the level of the share of the previously unrecognized losses.

## ➢ Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-Group  settlements  and  transactions,  as  well  as  unrealized  profits  arising  from  intra-Group transactions, are fully eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized profits resulting from transactions with associated or jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's participation percentage. Unrealized profits resulting from transactions with an associated entity are eliminated against the investment in the associate. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no indication of impairment.

## ➢ Currency conversions

The Group's financial statements are presented in RON, which is also the functional currency.

Foreign currency transactions are converted into RON using the exchange rate valid on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency at the end of the period are valued in RON using the exchange rate valid at the end of the financial year. Realized or unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the profit and loss account.

The company Safetech Innovations Global Services Limited prepares its individual financial statements in the national currency - GBP. Thus, for the purpose of consolidation, the statement of the global result was converted into RON using the average rate of the year and the statement of the financial position was converted at the closing rate.

The exchange rate was as follows:

Exchange  rate  differences,  favorable  or  unfavorable,  between  the  exchange  rate  from  the  date  of recording the receivables  or  liabilities  in  foreign  currency  or  the  exchange  rate  at  which  they  were reported in the previous financial statements and the exchange rate from the date of the end of the financial year, are recorded under financial income or expenses , as the case.

## IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers

IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers establishes a five-step model for recognizing and recording revenue resulting from contracts with customers. In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognized in the amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to the customer.

## Sales of goods

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods. The griup delivers goods under contractual conditions based on internationally accepted delivery conditions. The moment when the customer obtains control of the assets is considered to be substantially the same for most of the Group's contracts under IFRS 15. The Group believes that revenue should be recognized when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery of the goods.

## Revenue recognition from distinct performance obligations

The Group analyzed its contracts with customers to determine all its performance obligations, and did not identify any new performance obligations that should be accounted for separately in accordance with IFRS 15.

The Group provides monitoring, support and audit services regarding information security as its main activity.  Income  is  valued  at  the  expected  value  of  the  consideration received  or  to be received. In accordance with IFRS 15, the total consideration from service contracts is allocated to all services based on their individual selling prices. Individual sales prices are established based on the list prices at which the Group provides the respective services in separate transactions. Based on the Group's assessment, the value allocated based on the relative individual selling prices of the services and the individual selling prices of the services are largely similar. Therefore, the application of IFRS 15 does not result in significant differences regarding the timing of revenue recognition for these services.

Equipment maintenance - Included in the transaction price for the sale of equipment is an after-sales service.

This service refers to maintenance work that may be required to be performed on the equipment for a period of one to three years after sale. This period can then be extended  if the customer requires additional years of maintenance services. Renewal of services after the three-year period will be for the price at which they are sold by the Group to all its customers on the date of renewal, regardless of the existence of a renewal option. Accordingly, the option to extend the renewal period does not provide any benefit to customers when they terminate the initial contract, and therefore no revenue has been deferred related to this renewal option. The maintenance service is considered to be a distinct service because it is regularly provided by the  Group to other customers independently and is available to customers from other providers in the market. Therefore, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to maintenance services based on the stand-alone selling price of those services. Revenues related to maintenance services are recognized over time. The transaction price allocated to these services is recognized as a contract liability at the time of the initial sales transaction and is amortized on a straightline basis over the service period (ie, one to three years when the services are purchased together with the underlying equipment).

The recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 15 are also applicable to the recognition and measurement of any gains or losses resulting from the disposal of non-financial assets (such as fixed assets and intangible assets), when this disposal is not in the normal course of business. However, upon transition, the effect of these changes is not significant for the Group.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

## Variable consideration

Some contracts with customers include trade price discounts or the right of return for quality defects. Currently, the revenues obtained from these sales are recognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of revenue reductions, commercial discounts recorded under accrual accounting when a reasonable estimate of revenue adjustments can be made.

According to IFRS 15, it is necessary to estimate the variable consideration at the beginning of the contract. Revenues are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the value of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur. Consequently, for those contracts for which the Group is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the discounts, the income is recognized earlier than when the return period passes or when a reasonable estimate can be made. In order to estimate the variable consideration to which it would be entitled, the Group applied the expected value method. At the same time, the cases of quality complaints (rights of return) are isolated and insignificant, based on information from past periods.

## Considerations related to the action in one's own name and as an intermediary

In accordance with IFRS 15, the assessment is based on the criterion of whether the Group controls the specific goods before transferring them to the end customer, rather than whether it has exposure to significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods.

The Group concluded that it acts in its own name in most of the contractual sales relationships, because it is the main provider in all revenue contracts, it has the right to set the price and it is exposed to the risks related to stocks. In the specific case of those contractual arrangements in which the Group does not  control  the  goods  before  transferring  them  to  the  final  customer,  it  has  the  capacity  of  an intermediary.

## IFRS 9 Financial instruments

## Financial assets

The financial assets of the Group are represented by trade receivables and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.

Initial recognition:  The  classification of financial assets  at  initial  recognition  depends  on  the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and on the Group's business model regarding  their  management.  With  the  exception  of  commercial  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical method, the Group initially evaluates a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction costs in the case of a financial asset that  is  not  evaluated  at  fair  value,  through  profit  or  loss.  Trade  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical cost are valued at the transaction price determined according to IFRS 15.

Subsequent  evaluation:  The  Group  measures  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost  if  the  following conditions are cumulatively met:

- i) The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows and;
2. ii) The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise at the specified dates to cash flows that represent exclusively payments of principal and interest from the principal amount in circulation (SPPI).

Financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently valued based on the effective interest method (EIR) and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or depreciated.

Derecognition: A financial asset (or, if applicable, part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when:

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

- i) The rights to receive cash flows arising from the asset have expired;
2. ii) The Group transferred its rights to receive the cash flows arising from the asset or assumed an obligation to pay the cash flows collected in full, without significant delays, to a third party, based on a commitment with identical flows; and (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or (b) the Group has not transferred and retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control over the asset;
3. iii) The Group has transferred its rights to receive the cash flows from an asset or entered into a commitment with identical flows and has neither transferred nor retained significantly all the risks and rewards related to the asset, but neither has transferred control over the asset, the asset  is  recognized  proportionally  to  the  continuation  of  the  Group's  involvement  in  the respective asset. In this case, the Group also recognizes an associated debt.
4. iv) The transferred asset and the associated debt are evaluated on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. The continuation of the involvement that takes the form of a guarantee regarding the transferred asset is evaluated at the lower value between the initial accounting value of the asset and the maximum value of the consideration that could be imposed on the Group to reimburse it.

Impairment of financial assets: The Group recognizes a provision for expected credit  losses for all financial assets attached to liabilities that are not held at fair value through profit or loss. For trade receivables and contractual assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating expected losses. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but recognizes, instead, a provision based on the expected lifetime loss data at each reporting date. The Group analyzes the receivables individually and takes into account the effect of the financial guarantees received from the insurers in the calculation of expected losses from lending. For more information, see Note 12 - Trade receivables and other receivables.

## Financial debts

Initial recognition: Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and credits or derivatives designated as hedging instruments within an effective hedge, as the  case  may  be.  The  Group  determines  the  classification  of  its  financial  liabilities  upon  initial recognition.

Subsequent evaluation: The Group evaluates financial debts according to their classification, as follows:

- i) Loans and credits: interest-bearing loans are subsequently evaluated at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognized in the profit and loss account when debts are derecognized, as well as during the amortization process at the effective interest rate. The amortized cost is calculated taking into account any discount or  purchase  premium  and  any  commissions  and  costs  that  are  an  integral  part  of  the effective interest rate. Amortization at the effective interest rate is included in the profit and loss account at financing costs.
2. ii) Financial guarantee contracts: The Group initially recognizes financial guarantee contracts as a debt at fair value, adjusted to the costs related to the transaction that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the debt is valued at the higher value of the best estimate of the expenditure necessary to settle the obligation present at the reporting date and the recognized value minus accumulated depreciation.

Derecognition: The  Group  derecognizes  a  financial  debt  when  the  obligation  related  to  the  debt  is extinguished, is canceled or expires. If a financial debt is replaced by another debt from the same creditor under substantially different conditions, or if the terms of an existing debt change substantially, this exchange or change is treated as a derecognition of the original debt and a recognition of new debts. The difference between the related accounting values is recognized in the profit and loss account.

## Clearing of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net value reported in the statement of financial position only if there is currently both a legal right to offset the recognized amounts and an intention to settle on a net basis or to capitalize the assets and settle the debts simultaneously.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

## Interest income

The interest income generated by a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the Group will obtain  economic  benefits  and  when  that  income  can  be  reliably  measured.  Interest  income  is accumulated over time, by reference to the principal and the applicable effective interest rate, i.e. the rate that exactly updates the estimated future cash receipts over the anticipated period of the financial asset to the net book value of the asset at the date of initial recognition. Interest income is included in the profit and loss account under financial income.

## Tax

## Current profit tax

Current income tax receivables and payables for the current period are valued at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and fiscal laws used to calculate the amounts are those adopted or to a large extent adopted at the reporting date by Romanian legislation.

The current profit tax related to the elements recognized directly in equity is recognized directly in equity, not in the profit and loss account. The management periodically evaluates the positions presented in the fiscal declarations regarding the situations in which the applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and constitute provisions if necessary.

Income tax is calculated and paid according to the legislation in force by each Company within the Group.

The tax rates for the countries of which the companies in the group are part are:

| Country of origin       | Tax rate   |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Romania                 | 16%        |
| United Kingdom          | 25%        |
| Kingdom of Saudi Arabia | 20%        |

## Deferred tax

Deferred  tax  is  presented  applying  the  variable  ratio  method  regarding  the  temporary  differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their accounting value for the purpose of financial reporting at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, unless:

- i) The deferred tax liability arises from the  initial recognition  of  goodwill  or a  net  asset or liability  in  a  transaction  that  is  not  a  business  combination  and,  at  the  date  of  the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss ;
2. ii) Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax credit carryforwards and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit  will  be  available  against  which  the  deductible  temporary  differences  and  credit carryforwards can be utilised. unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, unless;
3. iii) The deferred tax asset related to deductible temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the date of the transaction, does not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of the deferred tax asset to be used. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow recovery of the deferred tax asset.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are valued at the tax rates expected to be applied for the period in which the asset is realized or the debt is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that have been adopted or to a large extent adopted up to reporting date.

Deferred tax on items recognized outside profit and loss is recognized outside profit and loss. The elements regarding the deferred tax are recognized in correlation with the transaction supporting other elements of the global result or directly in the equity.

Deferred tax receivables and liabilities are offset if there is a legal right to offset current tax receivables with current profit tax liabilities and deferred taxes refer to the same taxable entity and the same fiscal authority.

## VAT

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognized net of VAT, except for:

- The  case  in  which  the  sales  tax  applicable  to  the  purchase  of  assets  or  services  is  not recoverable, in this case the sales tax being recognized as part of the asset acquisition cost or as part of the expense element, as the case may be;
- Receivables and payables presented at a value including sales tax.

The net value of the sales tax recoverable from or paid to ANAF is included as part of receivables and payables in the statement of financial position.

In 2024, the value added tax rates depending on the country of origin of the companies within the Group are:

| Romania                 | Rate   |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Standard VAT rate       | 19%    |
| Reduced VAT rate        | 9%     |
| Reduced VAT rate        | 5%     |
| United Kingdom          |        |
| Standard VAT rate       | 20%    |
| Reduced VAT rate        | 5%     |
| Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |        |
| Standard VAT rate       | 11%    |

## Tangible assets

## Initial assessment

Tangible assets are valued at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and/or accumulated impairment losses, if applicable.

This cost includes the replacement cost of the respective tangible fixed asset at the time of replacement and the cost of borrowing for long-term construction projects, if the recognition criteria are met.

When significant parts of tangible assets must be replaced at certain intervals, the Group recognizes the respective parts as individual assets with a specific useful life and depreciates them accordingly. Also, when carrying out a general inspection, its cost is recognized in the accounting value of tangible assets as a replacement, if the recognition criteria are met. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the profit and loss account when incurred. The present value of the expected costs for scrapping  the  asset  after  its  use  is  included  in  the  cost  of  the  respective  asset  if  the  criteria  for recognizing a provision are met.

The cost of a tangible asset consists of:

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

- its  purchase  price,  including  customs  duties  and  non-refundable  purchase  taxes,  after deducting trade discounts and rebates;
- any costs that can  be directly attributed  to  bringing  the  asset  to  the  location  and  condition necessary for it to function in the manner desired by management;
- the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and moving the element and rehabilitating the location where it is located, the obligation that the entity bears when acquiring the element or as a consequence of using the element for a certain period for purposes other than those of producing stocks during that period.

## Subsequent evaluation

Fixed  assets  are  valued  at  historical  cost  from  which  amortization  and  possible  adjustments  for depreciation are deducted.

## Depreciation of fixed assets

Depreciation is calculated using:

- the linear method for buildings and equipment that are not related to production capacity
- the  accelerated  method  for  fixed  assets  representing  equipment  that  are  related  to  the production capacity

## Useful life of assets

The period of economic use is the period of time in which the asset is expected to be used by a company. The economic useful life for tangible assets was determined by specialized employees. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line or accelerated method, over the entire useful life of the asset.

The average lifetimes by category of fixed assets are as follows:

|                             | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Fixed assets for production | 2-8     |
| Transport vehicles          | 6       |

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future  economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss resulting from the derecognition of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds on disposal and the accounting value of the item) is included in the profit and loss account when the asset is derecognised.

The residual values, lifetimes and depreciation methods of fixed assets are reviewed at the end of each financial year and adjusted accordingly.

## ➢ Leasing

The Group evaluates whether a contract is or includes a leasing contract, at the initiation of the contract, that is, if that contract grants the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.

.

## The Group as lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and valuation approach for all leasing contracts, except for shortterm  leasing  contracts  and  leasing  contracts  for  which  the  underlying  asset  has  a  low  value.  The company recognizes leasing liabilities for making lease payments and right-of-use assets that represent the right to use the underlying assets.

## Right of use asset

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset on the date the lease contract commences (ie the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are valued at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses and adjusted for any revaluation of lease liabilities. The cost of the asset related to the right of use includes the value of the initial evaluation of the rent liability, the initial direct costs incurred and the related rent payments made on or before the start date of the development, less the incentives received under the rental contract.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the assets, as follows:

- Buildings

8 years

The right-of-use asset is also subject to impairment in accordance with the policy for impairment of nonfinancial assets described below.

## Lease liabilities

On the date of commencement of the leasing contract, the Group recognizes the leasing debt at the updated value of the leasing payments that must be made during the duration of the leasing contract. Lease payments include fixed payments (including fixed payments in the fund) less any lease incentives to be received, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and amounts expected to be paid  based  on  residual  value  guarantees.  Leasing  payments  also  include  the  exercise  price  of  a purchase option, if the Group has reasonable certainty that it will exercise the option, as well as the payment of the penalties for terminating the leasing contract, if the duration of the leasing contract reflects the Group's exercise of a termination options. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or context that triggers this payment occurs.

When calculating the updated value of the leasing payments, the Group uses the marginal loan rate from the start date of the leasing contract, if the implicit interest rate in the leasing contract cannot be determined immediately. After the start date, the value of the lease liabilities is increased to reflect the interest and reduced by the value of the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is reassessed if there is a change, a change in the lease term, a change in lease payments (for example, changes in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used for determining those payments) or a change in the valuation of a call option on the underlying asset.

## Short-term leasing contracts and leasing contracts for which the underlying asset has a low value

As of December 31, 2024, the Group has no short-term leasing contracts or leasing contracts for which the underlying asset has a low value.

The Group applies IFRS 16 for the recognition of leased cars and for office space leases. In 2024, the group company SAFETECH INNOVATIONS GLOBAL SERVICES LIMITED entered into a one-year lease agreement that was considered short-term, as IFRS 16 was not applied.

## ➢ Intangible assets

Separately acquired intangible assets are valued at initial recognition at cost. After initial recognition, intangible  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortization  and  any  accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the expense is reflected in the profit and loss account at the time the expense is incurred.

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as determinable.

Intangible assets with a determined useful life are amortized over their economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there are  indications  of  impairment  of  the  intangible  asset.  The  amortization period and amortization method for an intangible asset with a definite useful life are reviewed at least

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful lives or in the expected rate of consumption of the future economic benefits incorporated in the assets are accounted for by changing the method or the amortization period, as the case may be, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The expense of amortization of intangible assets with a useful life is recognized in the profit and loss account in the expense category in accordance with the function of intangible assets.

|                                   | Years   |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Computer programs                 | 2-3     |
| Research and development expenses | 5       |

Gains or losses resulting from the derecognition of an intangible asset are calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the accounting value of the item and is recognized in the profit and loss account when the asset is derecognised.

## Research and development expenses

Research costs are recognized as an expense when incurred. The expenses related to the development of an individual project are recognized as intangible assets when the Group can demonstrate:

- The technical feasibility required to complete the intangible asset so that it is available for use or sale;
- His intention to complete the intangible asset and the ability to use or sell it;
- The way in which the intangible immobilization will generate future economic benefits;
- Availability of resources to complete the immobilization;
- Its ability to reliably evaluate the expenses during the development of the immobilization.

After the initial recognition of the development expense of an asset, the cost model is applied, which provides for the accounting of assets at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation of fixed assets begins when the development is completed and the asset is available for sale/use. It is amortized over the period of the expected future benefit. Depreciation is recognized in the cost of goods sold. During the development period, the asset is tested annually for impairment.

## Patents, licenses, trademarks

Patents, licenses, trademarks are recognized as intangible assets and evaluated according to the useful life period (definite - amortized, indefinite period - tested for impairment).

## Derecognition of intangible assets

An intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from  its  use  or  disposal.  Gains  or  losses  resulting  from  the  derecognition  of  an  intangible  asset, assessed as the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the net book value of the asset, are recognized in profit and loss when the asset is recognisable.

## ➢ Government subsidies

Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the related conditions and that the grants will be received. Government subsidies are recognized in profit or loss systematically over the periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the subsidies are intended to compensate. Specifically, government grants whose main condition is that the Group purchases, constructs or otherwise acquires fixed assets (including tangible and  intangible  fixed  assets)  are  recognized  as  deferred  income  in  the  consolidated  statement  of

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

financial position and transferred to profit or loss for a period. Systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the related assets.

Government subsidies that are to be received as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of providing immediate financial support to the Group, without related future costs, are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.

## ➢ Inventories

The main categories of stocks are raw materials, goods and consumables.

The cost of stocks includes all purchase expenses, production costs (including all direct and indirect costs attributable to the operational activity of production) and other costs incurred in bringing the stocks to their current state and location.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price under the conditions of normal operation of the business less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs.

At the end of management, stocks are valued based on the FIFO method.

The Group periodically inventories the stocks to determine if they are damaged, obsolete, have slow movement or if the net realizable value has decreased, and makes the necessary adjustments.

## ➢ Depreciation of non-financial assets

The Group evaluates at each reporting date if there are indications of impairment of an asset. If there are  indications  or  if  an  annual  impairment  test  is  necessary  for  an  asset,  the  Group  estimates  the recoverable value of that asset. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the fair value of an asset (or cash-generating unit) minus the costs associated with the sale and its value in use. This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those of other assets or groups of assets. When the book value of an asset or cashgenerating unit is greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and its book value is reduced to its recoverable amount.

In case of internally developed software, the first step in the analysis for the depreciation is that the ROA for the year (value of the realised revenuegenerated) should not be less than 20% of the net asset value at the year end. If the value of the generated income is less than 20%, the method mentioned below is used. In case generated revenue exceeds 20%, then there is no need to adjust for depreciation.

When assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and assetspecific risks. When determining the fair value minus the costs associated with the sale, recent market transactions are taken into account, if any. If such transactions cannot be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.

The loss from the depreciation of continuing activities, including the depreciation of stocks, is recognized in the profit and loss account in the expense category consistent with the function of the depreciated asset, except for a property that was previously revalued and the revaluation was accounted for in other elements of the comprehensive result. In this case, the impairment is also recognized in other elements of the overall result up to the value of any previous revaluation.

In each reporting period, an assessment is made to determine if there are indicators that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If there is such an indication, the Company estimates the recoverable value of the asset or the treasury generating unit. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount. The reversal is limited, so that the accounting value of the asset does not exceed its recoverable value and does not exceed the accounting value that the asset

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

would have had if it had not been previously depreciated. Such reversal is recognized in the profit and loss account unless the asset has been revalued, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

## ➢ Cash and short-term deposits

Cash and short-term deposits from the statement of financial position include cash at home and at banks and short-term deposits with an initial maturity of three months or less.

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are made up of cash and short-term deposits defined above, net of outstanding overdrafts.

## ➢ Provisions

## General

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a current obligation (legal or implied) generated by a previous event, it is likely that an outflow of resources incorporating economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the value of the obligation can be reliably estimated. If the Group expects that a provision will be fully or partially reimbursed, for example, based on an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only if the reimbursement is almost certain. The related expense of any provision is presented in the profit and loss account, net of any reimbursement.

Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect management's current best estimate in this regard. If an outflow of resources is no longer likely to settle an obligation, the provision must be canceled by resuming income.

## Provisions for litigation

Litigation provisions are recognized when management estimates probable cash outflows as a result of unfavorable litigation.

## ➢ Pensions and other post-employment benefits

As part of its current activity, the Parent Company makes payments to the Romanian state on behalf of its employees for post-employment (retirement) benefits. All employees of the group are included in the pension plan of the Romanian State. The Group does not operate any other pension scheme and, consequently, has no obligation regarding pensions. In addition, the Group has no obligation to provide additional benefits to former or current employees.

## 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND HYPOTHESES

The preparation of the  Group's financial statements  requires  the management  to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values for revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, as well as the presented information that accompanies them, and to present the contingent liabilities at the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  However,  the  existing  uncertainty  related  to  these  estimates  and assumptions could result in a significant future adjustment of the accounting value of the affected asset or liability in future periods. Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and  other  factors  that  are  deemed  relevant.  Actual  results  may  differ  from  these  estimates.  The underlying estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The following are the critical  judgments, other than those involving estimates (which are presented separately below), that the  Group 's management made in the process of applying the Company's accounting  policies  and  which  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  financial statements.

## Argument

During  the  application  of  the  Group's  accounting  policies,  the  management  made  the  following considerations, which have the greatest effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements:

- Reasoning in determining the fulfillment of enforcement obligations

In making their judgment, the directors have considered the detailed revenue recognition criteria set out in IFRS 15 and, in particular, whether the Group has transferred control of the assets to client. Following the  detailed  quantification  of  the  Group's  liability  regarding  the  rectification  works,  and  the  agreed limitation on the customer's ability to request additional work or to request the replacement of goods, the directors are satisfied that control has been transferred and that the recognition of income in the current  year  is  appropriate,  together  with  the  recognition  of  an  appropriate  warranty  provision  for rectification costs.

- Reasoning regarding the capitalization of expenses as an intangible asset

In accordance with IAS 38, the capitalization of expenses as intangible assets regarding research, startup costs, pre-exploitation and pre-opening, training, advertising and promotion, moving and relocation previously recognized in GAAP as assets are de-recognized in the position opening situation financial IFRS. Following a detailed analysis of the Group's expenses regarding the recognition of intangible assets, the Group's management considered that the recognition of assets in the reported period is appropriate.

During the current year, the Parent Company capitalised development costs of RON 14 million relating to  software,  on  the  basis  that  management  considers  these  costs  to  be  clearly  associated  with identifiable  products  which  will  be  controlled  by  the  Parent  Company  and  have  a  profitable  benefit exceeding the cost beyond one year.

Capitalised costs related to three main software products, as presented in Note 10.

As mentioned above, in capitalising these development costs, management considered that the criteria in IAS 38, Intangible Assets (IAS 38) is met and development expenditure that does not meet the above criteria are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as these are incurred.

## Estimates and assumptions

The main assumptions regarding the future and other important causes of the uncertainty of estimates at  the  reporting  date,  which  present  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  significant  adjustment  of  the accounting values of assets and liabilities in the next financial year, are presented below.

## Taxes, fees and tax provisions

There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation of complex fiscal regulations, changes in fiscal legislation and the value and timing of future taxable profit.

All amounts owed to state authorities have been paid or ascertained at the balance sheet date. The Romanian  fiscal  system  is  undergoing  a  consolidation  process  and  is  in  the  process  of  being harmonized  with  European  legislation.  Different  interpretations  may  exist  at  the  level  of  the  tax authorities in relation to the tax legislation which may lead to additional taxes and penalties. If the state authorities find fiscal violations and related regulations, it may lead to: confiscation of the amounts in the case; additional tax obligations; fines and penalties (which are applied to the outstanding amount). As a result, the tax penalties resulting from the violation of the legal provisions can lead to a significant debt.

At the end of each financial year, the Group makes an estimate of the potential fiscal risks to which it may be subjected and determines the level of potential risk, using the best available estimates, and consequently, if necessary, recognizes a specific provision in the financial statements.

## Inventories

Finished  products  and  goods  are  recorded  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realizable  value.  The management analyzes the age of the stocks, the expiration date of the products, the quality of the products and possible non-conformity issues, the products that cannot be sold later or that are rejected based on quality problems, and takes into account their implications in determining the net realizable value of the stocks old.

The net realizable value is the sale price under normal business conditions, less completion, marketing and distribution costs, considering the future evolution of sale prices.

The management analyzed the net realizable value of the finished products monthly, taking into account the selling prices of the market as well as the regulations specific to the industry in which it operates.

For the raw materials, specific analyzes are carried out taking into account the age, expiration date, possible quality problems of the elements in the balance.

All assumptions are reviewed annually.

## Provisions for litigation

The Group recognizes provisions for litigation related to the risks identified in connection with certain lawsuits pending before the courts, the outcome of which is not certain.

## The lifetimes for fixed assets and the depreciation method

The Group estimates the life spans for the  items  of  tangible assets  in accordance with the rate of consumption / wear and tear for the respective assets.

The Group considers and uses the following depreciation methods:

- the linear method for buildings, fixed assets purchased in financial leasing and for equipment that are not related to production capacity
- the  accelerated  method  for  fixed  assets  representing  equipment  that  are  related  to  the production capacity

## Sales discounts for estimated returns, discounts

Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates related to sales are recognized as reductions in turnover, in the  period  in  which  the  respective  sales  were  recognized.  These  are  recognized  according  to commercial offers with monthly, quarterly and annual gross and net value targets. Estimated unbilled discounts are subject to continuous review and appropriate adjustment based on the latest available information.

Own products  are  included  in  the  category  of  research  and  development  expenses:  currently,  the company has a number of its own cyber security products under development or that it intends to develop, which will bring new added value to customers.

iSAM - In March 2019, Safetech launched its first cybersecurity product - iSAM, the Information Security Automation Manager. iSAM enables information security managers of companies to better manage cyber security within their organization by automating certain processes, providing real-time updates on the level of cyber protection and enabling early detection of cyber security threats. Safetech holds the National Computer Program Registry certificate for iSAM.

The certificate was issued on 22.01.2020 by the Romanian Copyright Office. The main functionalities of the application developed by Safetech include:

- inventory of business processes and IT systems;
- management of security policies and standards within the organization;
- continuous analysis and management of risks and vulnerabilities;
- event and security incident management.

The solution automates some of the activities of information security officers, but also helps organize security reports, bringing together information from various departments, thus saving time and aligning the practices used in a company. The platform also has the option to generate almost instantaneous reports on the level of IT security within the organization, as well as to provide tools for the management of security indicators and risks.

The solution is mainly aimed at large companies in the financial-banking, healthcare, transport, energy, utilities and digital infrastructure sectors, ensuring compliance with the relevant IT security provisions applicable to these industries. iSAM helps companies comply with the following regulations currently applicable in Romania:

- Law 362/2018 on ensuring a high level of security of computer networks and systems;
-  Norm  4/2018  of  the  Financial  Supervision  Authority  (ASF)  regarding  the  management  of operational risks;
- BNR Regulation 3/2018 regarding the monitoring of the financial market and the infrastructure of payment instruments;
- General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (GDPR). The valorization of the project is carried out by two methods:
- Capitalization in the form of either a perpetual license or a subscription (annual service on premises - annually renewable) to the company's beneficiaries.
- Valorization in the form of streamlining the activity within the Security Operations Center - STI CERT company structure,  both  in  the  daily  security  monitoring  activities  of  the  company's beneficiaries, as well as in the security testing and information security management services.

During  2024  important  developments  were  made  to  the  iSAM  solution,  in  amount  of  RON  2.323 thousands, mainly representing software development employee costs, and subcontractors' costs.

SafePic (grant funded project that will be completed in 2023) - It aims to increase the response capacity of  STI-CERT  to  cyber  security  attacks  and  incidents,  through  automation  and  interoperability  with similar structures at national and international level, but also the development organizational by carrying out a set of design actions and implementing measures to improve the components of the management system  (strategy,  structure,  information  system,  decision-making  system,  methodological  system), aimed at increasing the performance and competitiveness of the organization. The project was carried out between June 2020 and July 2023, with a durability period of 3 years from completion (July 2026). The company is obliged to maintain the entire system developed within the project.

In 2024, the project continued in accordance with the development plan for the durability period, with expenses amounting to 5.690 thousand lei.

BCM - project started at the beginning of 2023, financed from own resources, with the aim of developing a  software  application  for  business  continuity  management.  Upon  completion  of  the  project,  the resulting  product  will  be  capitalized  through  subscription  licenses.  During  the  period  January  -

## 15. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

As detailed in the accounting policies, the Parent Company applies a defined employee benefit plan. The plan requires the company to pay the social insurance contribution for employees, in the public pension fund.

As part of its current activity, the  Parent Company makes payments to the Romanian state for the benefit of its employees. All employees of the parent company are included in the pension plan of the Romanian State. The company does not operate any other pension scheme or post-retirement benefit plan and, consequently, has no obligation regarding pensions. In addition, the Parent Company has no obligation to provide additional benefits to former or current employees.

Retirement  benefits:  The  Collective  Labor  Agreement  does  not  provide  for  any  benefits  that  the Company must grant to employees upon retirement based on seniority within the Parent Company and that could have an impact on the financial statements.

In 2022, the company approved the implementation of a plan to reward and motivate the Company's key personnel by granting free shares in the future. Details regarding this can be found in note 6.5.

## 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## Commitments from financing contracts:

In 2020, the Parent Company concluded a financing contract through the competitiveness operational program with the title: "Centre of excellence for cyber security and resilience of critical infrastructures" (SafePIC) SMIS Code 2014+:120436, Call Code: POC/222/1/ 3/ Stimulating the demand of enterprises for  innovation through CDI projects carried out by enterprises individually or in partnership with CD institutes and universities, in order to innovate processes and products in economic sectors with growth potential (MDR).

In order to advance the sustainability of the "Centre of excellence for cyber security and resilience of critical  infrastructures  (SafePIC)"  project,  the  management  of  the  parent  company  committed  to consider the following measures:

- -Looking at supporting ROI, Safetech Innovations has obtained expressions of interest / preorders from interested companies, confirming market interest in the product.
- -In preparing the financial forecasts, the principle of prudence was especially taken into account - revenues being estimated in a slightly pessimistic manner;
- -The financial sustainability of the project presupposes its ability to support itself from this point of view (in the worst case assuming the relationship income = expenses). The way in which the activity after the termination of the non-reimbursable financing is conceived and thought also takes into account the obtaining of profit (Revenue-Profit = Expenses). Thus, possible slightly erroneous estimates such as oversized revenues or undersized expenses would not make the company's activity unsustainable, diminishing the estimated profit to begin with.

The parent company has demonstrated that the enterprise has the ability to generate income from the capitalization of the project results, as well as the ability to cover the operating and maintenance costs after the end of the non-refundable financing, resulting from the commercialization of the products/services/technology obtained from the project, at least during the sustainability period of the 36-month project.

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

Over the entire analyzed time horizon, the cash flow is positive.

The applicant's ability to support itself financially in the period after implementation is also supported by the financial results that the company has had from a financial point of view since the beginning of its establishment, results obtained through effective financial management. Thus, the company's turnover over the period 2011-2014 evolved from 1.288.644 lei to 9.115.976 lei, maintaining an upward trend throughout the period.

Considering the overall evolution of the company, the risk that the company will not be able to meet its objectives  regarding  the  expected  return  on  investment  is  low.  From  the  point  of  view  of  technical sustainability, the main objective is to keep the innovative cyber security solution in optimal functional conditions.

The main measures (without being the only ones taken) undertaken by the company's management in this regard are the following:

- -Keeping all staff in the operating team, staff selected on the basis of competence and skills criteria, details given in chapter C of the business plan; for a good performance of the operation stage, the ideal way of working is for the personnel who were involved in the implementation stage to ensure the continuity of the activity during the sustainability period.
- -4 new jobs for qualified personnel in the field of cyber security, covering any current gap in the company in terms of technical requirements;
- -The training of the personnel who will subsequently ensure the maintenance of the product developed through the project, as well as the training of trainers who will ensure the training of the personnel to whom the product is directly addressed;
- -Ensuring continuous training for all members of the operating team;
- -Developing a manual with procedures for using the developed product;
- -Carrying  out  the  technical  audit  is  an  additional  measure  to  ensure  sustainability  from  a technical point of view. Considering the measures taken, it can be stated that the sustainability of  the  results  of  the  project  proposed  for  financing  will  be  supported  both  administratively, technically and financially. In addition, the existence of pre-orders and letters of interest confirm the market validation of the product developed by the project.

According  to  both  financing  contracts,  the  Parent  Company  has  the  obligation  to  submit  annual Sustainability Reports, after submitting the financial statements to ANAF, for the entire duration of the project,  starting  with  the  first  calendar  year  following  the  year  in  which  the  implementation  was completed.

Sustainability reports shall contain at least the following types of data and information regarding:

- a. changes to the beneficiary's status and identification data;
- b. how and where infrastructures, equipment and assets are used;
- c. how infrastructure investment or productive investment continues to generate results.

According to the financing agreements, in the case of projects that include productive or infrastructure investments and that are not co-financed from the ESF, the sustainability period of the project is a minimum of 3 years for the beneficiaries in the SME category, respectively a minimum of 5 years for the other categories of beneficiaries upon making the final payment under this contract or the period provided for in the state aid regulations, whichever is greater.

If the project includes investments in infrastructure or production, the beneficiary (unless the beneficiary is an SME) has the obligation not to relocate the production activity outside the European Union, within 10 years of making the final payment. If the contribution from the ESI funds takes the form of state aid, the 10-year period is replaced by the deadline applicable according to the rules on state aid.

The sustainability analysis of the project is carried out by the OIC based on the Sustainability Reports prepared by the beneficiary and the monitoring visits, in order to ensure the sustainability of the projects, as well as the fact that all contributions from the funds are attributed only to projects that, within 3/5 years after their conclusion, were not affected by any change in the category of those stated below, respectively:

- i. a substantial change affecting their nature, objectives or conditions of achievement and which would cause their original objectives to be undermined;
- ii. a change in the ownership of an infrastructure element that gives an unjustified advantage to an enterprise or a public body;
- iii. termination or relocation of a productive activity outside the eligible area

## Other commitments and contingencies:

Taxation All amounts owed to the State for taxes and duties have been paid or recorded at the balance sheet date.

The parent company considers that it has paid on time and in full all the fees, taxes, penalties and penalty interests, to the extent that it is the case.

The Romanian tax authorities did not carry out checks.

In Romania, the fiscal year remains open for checks for a period of 5 years.

Transfer price In accordance with the relevant tax legislation, the tax assessment of a transaction made with related parties is based on the concept of the market price related to that transaction. Based on  this  concept,  transfer  prices  must  be  adjusted  to  reflect  market  prices  that  would  have  been established between entities that do  not have an affiliation relationship  and that act independently, based on "normal market conditions".

During the reporting period, there were no transactions with related parties and there is a transfer price risk.

The Board of Directors reviews and agrees to the management policies for each of these risks which are briefly presented below.

Business plan risk -Safetech operates in what can still be considered a niche market, especially in Romania. The company aims for sustainable growth, based primarily on legislative changes at the level of the European Union, which will require companies in important sectors of activity, such as energy, utilities, critical infrastructure or in the financial-banking sector, to implement strict security measures cybernetics. However, in the past, the entry into force of such laws has been delayed in Romania, and management cannot predict or influence such situations in the future, which may have a direct impact on the realization of forecasts.

Key personnel risk - the success and ability to deliver projects to clients is highly dependent on staff skills,  motivation  and  loyalty.  The  Romanian  IT  market  is  very  competitive  and  there  are  risks  that employees  may  leave  the  company.  To  manage  these  risks,  Safetech  has  adapted  a  number  of measures:  offering  a  competitive  compensation  package  and  promotion  opportunities,  constant recruitment even when there are no ongoing projects just to be able to always meet the growing demand from customers. In addition, the company actively recruits early-career IT specialists, offering them training and development opportunities. Due to this aspect, the share of salaries in the general costs of doing business is the most significant, but this helps the company to maintain  its competitiveness. However, it is not guaranteed that Safetech will always be able to find the necessary number of qualified personnel, especially in the field of ethical hacking, which is highly specific and requires very specific skills.

The risk associated with making forecasts - financial forecasts start from the premise of fulfilling the business development plan. The company aims to periodically issue forecasts regarding the evolution of the main economic-financial indicators in order to provide potential investors and the capital market with a true and complete picture of the current situation and the future plans envisaged by the company, as well as current reports detailing the comparative elements between the forecasted data and the actual results obtained. The forecasts will be part of the annual reports, and the forecasting policy is published on the company's website HERE. Forecasts are made in a prudent manner, but there is a risk  of  their  non-fulfilment,  therefore,  the  data  to  be  reported  by  the  company  may  be  significantly different from those forecasted or estimated, as a result of factors that were not previously foreseen or whose negative impact could not be counteracted or anticipated.

Price risk - in 2016, in order to reduce price risk, the management decided to change the business strategy and focus on value-added services to the detriment of the sale of hardware, which in previous years contributed a significant share of revenues, but instead had a small profit margin. Thus, since 2017,  the  company  has  adjusted  its  model,  focusing  on  the  delivery  of  value-added  services  and

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

increasing  profitability.  Given  the  nature  of  Safetech's  business,  the  risk  of  commoditization  of  the business, i.e. the risk of the service or technology becoming very widespread and widely adopted, is reduced because the company relies heavily on the skills of its team of ethical hackers. Since the cost of hiring qualified IT professionals is very high not only in Romania, but also in the whole world, the risk that a competitor could force the company to lower the price of services in order to maintain its position in the market is relatively low. However, the management actively monitors the local and international markets to be able to always provide value-added services and maintain a leading position in the local market.

Cash-flow risk -  this  represents  the  risk  that  the  company  will  not  be  able  to  honor  its  payment obligations when due. A prudent cash-flow risk management policy involves maintaining a sufficient level of cash, cash equivalents and financial availability through appropriately contracted credit facilities. The Company monitors the level of forecasted cash inflows from the collection of trade receivables, as well as the level of forecasted cash outflows for the payment of trade and other payables. Thanks to this business model, which includes providing monitoring services for a fixed monthly fee, the company manages to maintain a healthy cash flow.

Credit risk - this is the risk that a third party natural or legal entity will not fulfill its obligations under a financial instrument or under a customer contract, thus leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and its financial activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The Company  manages  this  risk  by  carefully  selecting  customers  and  having  a  strict  procedure  for documenting orders and the provision of services or delivery of goods.

Liquidity risk - liquidity risk is associated with holding immovable or financial assets. The company's activity does not depend on holding immovable or financial assets and turning them into liquid assets. The company does not own any financial assets. The fixed assets of the company, mainly technological equipment, are used in the current activity of providing services.

Currency risk the possibility of recording losses from international commercial contracts or other economic relationships, due to changes in the exchange rate of the currency in the period between the conclusion of the contract and its maturity. As the company plans to expand into other international markets, from Europe or the US, it will be exposed to this type of risk.

Personal data protection risk - in the course of its business, the company collects, stores and uses data  that  is  protected  by  personal  data  protection  laws.  Although  the  issuer  takes  precautionary measures to protect customer data, in accordance with the legal requirements regarding the protection of privacy, especially in the context of the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/79 and in Romania (starting from May 25, 2018) , data leakage risks cannot be completely eliminated.  The  Company  considers  this  risk  and  takes  precautions  to  protect  customer  data  in accordance with applicable legal requirements. The Issuer takes all necessary precautions in this area, but there is a possibility that, considering that it carries out commercial relations with various contractual partners,  they  may  not  fully  comply  with  the  relevant  contractual  terms  and  all  the  data  protection obligations imposed on them.

Competition risk the entry of new competitors into the market, especially from outside Romania, will intensify competition and put pressure on the company's activity, with the risk of recording a decrease in profit and even its insolvency.

The risk of loss of reputation - is a risk inherent in the company's activity, reputation being particularly important in the business environment, especially in its field of activity, cyber security. Reputational risk is inherent in Safetech's business. The ability to retain and attract new customers also depends on the recognition of the Safetech brand and its reputation for service quality in the market. A negative public opinion of the company could result from actual or perceived practices in the cybersecurity market in general, such as negligence during the provision of services or even the way Safetech conducts or is perceived to conduct its business.

General economic risks - the issuer's activities are sensitive to economic cycles and general economic conditions.  Both  international  financial  crises  and  the  unstable  economic  environment  can  have significant negative effects on the activity, operational results and financial position of the issuer. Socio-

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

political turmoil can also impact the company's business. The international financial markets felt the effects of the global financial crisis that started in 2008. These effects were also felt on the Romanian financial market in the form of the low liquidity of the capital market, as well as through an increase in medium-term financing interest rates, because of the global liquidity crisis. In the future, such a scenario could be repeated and possible significant losses suffered by the international financial market, with major implications on the local market, could affect the Issuer's ability to obtain new loans or financing, under sustainable conditions.

Pandemic risk - although ignored in the last decades, this risk (especially the risk of global epidemics, respectively the risk of pandemics) has returned to the public's attention. Although for some companies these may become opportunities, at least in the short term, the overall economic impact is considered to be negative. Thus, there are opinions that, depending on the nature and severity of the pandemic, it can induce recessions lasting a quarter, or even several years. In conditions where the reactions of the public authorities and/or the medical community would not be the right ones, there is even a risk of a depression that would lead to important reductions in economic activity and in the price of most assets. For example, in the first months of 2020, a coronavirus pandemic (SARS-COV-2), known as COVID19, emerged. This pandemic has resulted in declines of more than 25% from their most recent highs for  major  stock  indices  globally.  This  has  similarly  influenced  the  local  capital  market.  Moreover, internationally,  most  major  asset  classes  have  been  severely  negatively  impacted,  even  those  that traditionally function as havens for investors.

Fiscal and legal risk - the issuer is governed by Romanian legislation and even if Romanian legislation has  been  largely  harmonized  with  European  Union  legislation,  subsequent  changes  may  occur, respectively new laws and regulations may be introduced, which may produce effects on the company's activity . Legislation in Romania is often unclear, subject to different interpretations and implementations and frequent changes. Both the modification of fiscal and legal legislation, as well as possible events generated by their application, can materialize in possible fines or lawsuits filed against the company, which can impact the activity of the issuer.

The risk associated with other types of litigation - in the context of the performance of its activity, the issuer is subject to a risk of litigation, among others, as a result of changes and development of legislation. The issuer may be affected by other contractual claims, complaints and litigation, including from counterparties with whom it has contractual relationships, customers, competitors or regulatory authorities, as well as any adverse publicity that such an event attracts. At the time of writing this report, Safetech Innovations S.A. was not involved in any litigation in an active or passive procedural capacity.

Risk of garnishment of the issuer's accounts - garnishment is an enforcement measure that can be applied to a company. Thus, the issuer's accounts may be blocked as a result of the seizure, if the issuer's  creditors  request  this  measure  to  recover  their  claims.  The  garnishment  of  the  Company's accounts entails the blocking of the amounts in the garnished accounts and may lead to the difficulty or impossibility of the Company to honor its subsequent obligations, in the agreed terms.

Risk  associated  with  insolvency  and  bankruptcy -  Romanian  bankruptcy  and  enforcement legislation does not offer the same level of rights, remedies and projections enjoyed by creditors under the  legal  regimes  of  other  European  Union  jurisdictions.  In  particular,  Romanian  bankruptcy  and enforcement law and practice may make the company's recovery of amounts related to secured and unsecured  claims  in  Romanian  courts  much  more  difficult  and  time-consuming  compared  to  other countries.

Risks related to investments in Romania, in an economic and political context - Romania's economy is vulnerable in conditions of regional or international recession, financial and economic problems at a general level can be felt more acutely in certain markets or 28 sectors. Also, political and social changes can  be  an  unpredictable  factor.  Romania  does  not  possess  all  the  business,  legal  and  regulatory infrastructure  that  would  exist  in  a  developed  economy.  The  legislation  is  subject  to  varying interpretations and is frequently amended.

Geopolitical Risk - Safetech operates in a globalized market and, therefore, its business and revenues are  interdependent  on  global  macroeconomic  conditions.  International  efforts  to  limit  the  spread  of COVID-19 have had a significant negative effect on global macroeconomic conditions, which continue to cause economic uncertainty. In addition, the military conflict generated by the Russian Federation in

## SAFETECH INNOVATIONS S.A.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024 and 2023 (expressed in RON, unless otherwise specified)

Ukraine, instability in global credit markets, rising prices of essential commodities (oil, electricity, etc.), changes in public  policies,  such  as  domestic  and  international  ones,  such  as  regulations,  taxes  or international trade agreements, international trade disputes, change of governments, geopolitical unrest and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets continue to add uncertainty to global economic conditions. Management estimates that the war currently does not have an impact on the  financial  statements.  The  long-term  impact  cannot  be  predicted,  however,  at  the  date  of  these financial  statements,  the  Group  continues  to  meet  its  obligations  as  they  fall  due  and,  therefore, continues to apply the going concern basis of preparation.

Other risks - potential investors should consider that the risks presented above are the most significant risks of which the company is aware at the time of writing this report. However, the risks presented in this section do not necessarily include all those risks associated with the activity of the issuer, and the company cannot guarantee that it includes all relevant risks.

There may be other risk factors and uncertainties of which the company is not aware at the time of writing  the  report  and  which  may  change  the  actual  results,  financial  conditions,  performance  and achievements of the issuer in the future and may lead to a decrease in the price of the company's shares.  Investors  should  also  undertake  the  necessary  due  diligence  in  order  to  make  their  own assessment of the investment opportunity.

Impact on the environment The professional activity of Safetech Innovations has no impact on the environment.  There  is  no  litigation  and  no  litigation  is  expected  to  arise  related  to  environmental protection.

The  company  is  exposed  to  credit  risk,  liquidity  risk  and  market  risk  (mainly  currency  risk).  The Company's management oversees the management of these risks. All activities related to derivative financial instruments aimed at managing risks are carried out by teams of specialists who have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group's policy not to carry out transactions with derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Currency risk - Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in the exchange rate mainly refers to the Company's operating activities (when revenues or expenses are denominated in a currency other than the Company's functional currency).

The company has transactions in currencies other than its functional currency (RON).

The exposure to exchange rate risk (mainly due to the EUR and USD currencies) is not significant, so the Groupdoes not use risk hedging instruments.

## The sensitivity of the currency risk

## Trade receivables

The credit risk of customers is managed by the Group, subject to the established policy; however, the Group considers that the credit risk on the receivables is small. The receivables balance is monitored at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  and  any  major  delivery  to  a  customer  is  analysed.  Impairment indicators are analyzed at each reporting date.

The Group assesses the risk concentration regarding trade receivables as low.

## Financial instruments and cash deposits

The credit risk resulting from balances at banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group's treasury department, according to the Group's policies. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for  the  components  of  the  financial  position  statement  is  represented  by  the  accounting  values illustrated in Note 12.

## Liquidity risk
